<p><a name="abc"></a><strong>African Brotherhood Church (ABC)</strong></p>

<p>This church was founded in 1945 by Rev. Simeon Mulandi Kaasya formerly a Captain with the Salvation Army and the Gospel Furthering Fellowship (GFF). It started in Nairobi as the Akamba Christian Union in the GFF Church led by George Rhoads with Rev. Mulandi as his associate Pastor. The African Brotherhood Church has spread to most parts of Kenya and other African nations.</p>

<p>The ABC attracted some excommunicated members from the AIM in Ukambani because they accommodated some Akamba traditional practices that were not tolerated in the AIM and some other missions. The church also gained popularity because it aimed to restore the Akamba brotherhood lost during the colonial period and the coming of missionaries whom they accused of adversely affecting the Akamba brotherhood. The ABC started schools and hospitals which largely attracted the Akamba people and provided scholarships for individuals to attend theological seminaries so they could provide spiritual nourishment for the church. The restoration of some aspects of the Akamba traditional practices consistent with Christianity such as dowry payment and traditional marriage ceremonies, to mention a few, made the church popular. The ABC affiliated itself with the Mau Mau and the Kenyan nationalist groups opposed to the colonial government. Consequently, it is classified as a nationalist African Instituted Church. The church has a million followers and has spread to Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Congo and Zambia. The church partners with local NGOs to address development issues, education needs, the perennial food security problems and poverty in the region.</p>

<p><a name="mulembe"></a><strong>African Ministry of Jesus Christ (<em>Mulembe</em> Church)</strong></p>

<p>In 1957 a splinter group from the Anglican Church of Kenya started this church that was initially called the Church of Christ in Africa with Matayo Ocholla as its first bishop. The church originally included members from both the Dholuo and Luyha communities. However, between 1968 and 1970 the leaders of the Church of Christ in Africa were involved in conflicts which ended up in court. As a result, the two communities formed their own splinter groups, the Dholuo calling their church Johera and the Luyha naming theirs African Ministry of Jesus Christ (<em>Mulembe</em> Church).</p>

<p>The <em>Mulembe</em> Church is a charismatic African church which accommodates African religious worship and rituals. It has many celebrations which include the Easter holiday, <em>Ukumbusho</em>, the harvest, the day they formed their splinter group, and many others. These celebration days are marked with drama and dances accompanied by African instruments. It has had many followers in Western Kenya. Accommodation of African traditional practices like polygamy, the use of African worship style, and the use of traditional instruments has made it popular especially to those who do not fit in the mainline churches where these practices are forbidden. The bishop is their top leader followed by the padre, evangelists, and lay leaders.</p>

<p><a name="akorinu"></a><strong><em>Akorinu</em> Movement</strong></p>

<p>The <em>Akorinu</em> movement, also known as watu wa mungu, was founded by Joseph Nga’ng’a of Kiambu District, during the colonial era of the late 1920s and early 1930s. The movement formed to protest against the colonizers who took the Kikuyu people’s land. The colonizers also inflicted pain upon the Kikuyus through forced labor, the payment of taxes, and forcing them to abandon their cultural way of life.</p>

<p>The <em>Akorinu</em> Church claims to be guided by the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Elijah. It mainly bases its teaching on Acts 2:17, Joel 2:28, and Hebrews 8:1,10,13. They hold to Agikuyu traditional practices like polygamy, circumcision, ritual uncleanness, and communication with ancestral spirits. They practice baptism by the Holy Spirit, and re-interpret the Bible to accommodate the African people’s socio-religio-cultural practices. They pray facing Mt. Kenya and believe that God lives on Mt Kenya. The Akorinu Church has had an impact on Kenyan society because of their work ethic, humility, honesty, and a spirituality derived from the African religious worldview. It has given rise to various churches like the Holy Ghost Church of East Africa, God’s Word Holy Ghost Church, Foundations of the Prophet Church, Chosen Church of Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit Church of Zion, African Holy Ghost Christian Church, and African Mission of the Holy Ghost Church of East Africa.</p>

<p><a name="bibleway"></a><strong>The Bible Way Restoration Ministries</strong></p>

<p>This charismatic church was started by Bishop Kinoga who was born, raised, and trained as a theologian in the Anglican Church of Kenya. After a period he declined to serve with the Anglican Church of Kenya but chose to work with Bishop Evans Mrima’s church called the Gospel Outreach Ministries until Mrima died. Mrima’s death caused division in the Gospel Outreach Ministries Church when the pastors failed to elect a bishop because each of them wanted to become bishop. At this point Kinoga started the Bible Way Restoration Ministries, thus named because after the bishop’s death each of the pastors went and started a church and the former members were left in darkness and without a leader. According to Kinoga, the Bible Way Restoration Ministries provided restoration and a way for former members of the Gospel Outreach Ministries. The church encourages Bible reading among all members, the giving of tithes, the ministration of the Holy Spirit, praise and worship celebrations, the inclusion of African song and dance in the services, the gift of prophecy, healing, and baptism by immersion. The bishop is the highest leader followed by the pastors and church elders.</p>

<p><a name="chrisco"></a><strong>Chrisco Fellowship Church</strong></p>

<p>This church was started in 1978 by Apostle Harry Das who came to Nairobi for two weeks in 1977. After these two weeks God called him to settle in Kenya and pray for this nation that was wracked by ethnic hatred, to teach Kenyans to reach spiritual maturity and help foster unity among pastors, church leaders, and believers who came his way. Das was introduced to Christianity by an elderly black woman when he was in his twenties. Dan and his wife Cora were both born and raised in Guyana, South America–Das of Indian descent and Cora of African descent. The two met when he was pastoring in Guyana and they married much later in the U.S.A., when he was 45 in 1972.*</p>

<p>The name “Chrisco” stands for “Christ’s co-workers’ church.” Initially the Chrisco Church started both a “morning glory” service when people could meet for prayers before their offices or work places opened and lunch hour services. These meetings were initially held at All Saints Cathedral, at Cameo Cinema on Kenyatta Avenue, and on the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) ground floor. The number of members meeting in these prayer fellowships increased and they converted the prayer meetings into the Chrisco Church.</p>

<p>The Chrisco Church is founded on New Testament teachings especially the fivefold ministry gifts of apostleship, prophesy, teaching, evangelism, and pastoral ministries given by God to the church. The church has a following among working class people in big towns. Its unique method of evangelism makes it popular. Its radio and TV evangelism has made it known all over the country. The church also evangelizes through literature printed on its own printing press.</p>

<p><a name="lastappeal"></a><strong>God’s Last Appeal Church (Mama Susana)</strong></p>

<p>The church was started in 1963 in South Nyanza by Mama Susana who was formerly a member of the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) Church. Mama Susana who is referred to as a prophet of the church was eventually joined by Mr. Zedekia Oduma and Mrs. Opiyo Matewa who claimed to have received healing from Mama Susana. They helped in establishing the church in South Nyanza, Yimbo, and Bondo areas. The church’s doctrines are similar to those of the SDA church but with very strict observance of the Sabbath. They practice prayer and fasting on designated days and prayer for the sick by special people.

<p><a name="israel"></a><strong>Israel Church of God</strong></p>

<p>Daudi Paul Kivuli and Philemon Orwa started this church in 1941 in Bunyore. Daudi, a former Anglican, belonged to the Luhya community and Orwa, previously a member of Pentecostal churches, was a Luo. They joined efforts and started the Uhuru Israel Church. At the time the church started, Kenya had not gained independence. They were forced to change its name to African Israel Church with Bunyore as its headquarters and Daudi Paul Kivuli as the leader of the church assisted by Philemon Orwa.</p>

<p>After Daudi’s death in 1975, the church split. Under the leadership of Ayago, the Luo community formed their diocese while the Luyha changed the name of the church to the Israel Church of Africa. The church has since then changed its name several times as the leadership has changed. The church has adopted African traditional practices and criticizes any form of Western influence in worship. As a result it has especially penetrated the Luo and the Luyha communities.</p>

<p>This charismatic church was started by Bishop Francis N. Wanderi in the year 2001 in Kerugoya Town in Kerugoya District in Central Province, Kenya. Wanderi was born and raised in the Presbyterian Church of East Africa (PCEA). Before starting the People’s Church, he was a primary school teacher.

He resigned from the African Christian Church where he had served for more than nine years because he felt the church was more structural than relational.</p>

<p>The People’s Church Ministries’ theology is based on Mark 11:17 and Revelation 10:11. The church belongs to the people of God and teaches self reliance through faithful giving of offerings, evangelism, and biblical theology. They observe Biblical rites like child dedication, marriage, baptism by immersion, the Lord’s Supper, anointing oil, the laying on of hands, funeral/burial rites, and speaking in tongues. The church has had a local impact because of its commitment to reach out to people, especially the poor and the marginalized. It contributes money and food to the poor. Its “Grace/ Mercy Ministry” liaises with the Ministry of Health by donating hospital beds and other items needed in the hospitals in the area. These charitable initiatives have made the church popular in the area.</p>

<p><a name="redeemed"></a><strong>The Redeemed Gospel Church</strong></p>

<p>This charismatic church was started in 1974 in the Mathare slums in Nairobi by Bishop Arthur Kitonga who sought asylum from Uganda where he was serving as a pastor of the Anglican Church during the brutal regime of Idi Amin Dada. The same year his close friend Bishop Paul Mutua joined him and helped to start another branch in Machakos. Their preaching method targeted students in schools to teach them the faith so that they would share their faith after school. This preaching method helped to spread the RGC which is now established throughout Kenya and can currently be found in most of Africa. The RGC draws its teachings from the Bible and emphasizes the principle of <em>sola scriptura</em> (the Bible as its own interpreter). It includes women in its ministries and has even ordained women as pastors. The RGC facilitated the ordination of Bishop Margaret Wanjiru of <a href="#jiam">Jesus Is Alive Ministries</a> (JIAM). RGC doctrine emphasizes the Trinity, prayer, tithes, offerings, and Christian morality. In its organizational structure the bishop is the highest leader, followed by the pastors, evangelists, deacons, and lay leaders. The church has had an impact on society through its inclusion of women in ministry, its special programs for the poor, the widows and orphans, and other marginalized groups.</p>

<p><a name="rohomuyia"></a><strong><em>Roho Muyia</em> Church Movement</strong></p>

<p>This charismatic Neo-Pentecostal movement was started in 1997 by Rev. Patrick Mulunga who was born and raised in the Catholic Church. He had been a faithful Catholic in his youth, serving as an altar boy during Mass. Before finishing secondary school, he joined bad company that corrupted his morals. As a result, he spent most of his life in prison and in running battles with the police. After several years in prison he became ill and claimed to have had a vision of starting a church and serving God. Mulunga moved to Mumias Town where he began the ministry. The church has attracted the youth in large numbers because of its programs that are dominated by loud music and relaxed rules that the youth can easily follow. Because it has a special ministry to the poor and the orphans, the church has penetrated most of Western Kenya. It accommodates second wives, polygamists, and those who have left the mainline churches for other reasons. Its organization includes the bishop, pastors, and lay leaders. They do not emphasize theological training for their clergy. The church claims to drive away evil spirits and witchcraft, and believes in miracles through prayers from their bishop.</p>
