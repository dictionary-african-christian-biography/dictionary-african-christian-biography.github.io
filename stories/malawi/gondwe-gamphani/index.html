        <h3 id="early-life">Early Life</h3>

<p>Hamilton Gondwe was born on March 13, 1946, to Solomon Gamphani Gondwe and Funny Zgambo in Vitendwe village, in the district of Paramount Chief Chikulamayembe 11, in Rumphi, northern Malawi. Hamilton was the last born in a family of boys. His brothers were Gibson, Esau, Stuart, William, Pearson and Jofu. [1] When he was seven years old, he enrolled at Luviri primary school. He was a brilliant boy who was able to calculate <em>ziwalo</em> (maths) on his own and to teach others. He was selected to continue his education at Dedza Secondary School, one of the best schools in the country at that time. [2] He worked hard at school and achieved good results.</p>

<p>In 1974, he married his childhood sweetheart Lilly Mhango. Lilly had planned to become a nurse, but when she heard that Hamilton was not keen on the nursing profession, she changed direction and trained as a teacher. The family settled in Blantyre where Hamilton was employed by Malawi Telecommunications as a telephone cable technician, while Lilly found a teaching job at Mpemba Boys. Their first child, a daughter, Ezelina, was born in 1976, and in 1978 they had a son named Gibson. Two more sons, Symon and then Stuart, completed the family. [3]</p>

<p>While in Blantyre, Hamilton started drinking heavily, spending his time with fellow drunkards in the taverns of Chilomoni where they had made their home. He was popular socially and enjoyed spending his money on drinking sessions with his friends. He was rarely seen at church. [4] Despite his heavy drinking, Hamilton was a good man, cheerful and helpful in the community. The high quality of his work for Malawi Telecommunications earned him promotion and he became a senior technician. Regrettably, due to corruption, he was arrested, convicted, and spent two-and-a-half years in prison. [5]</p>

<h3 id="new-life-in-christ-and-ministry">New Life in Christ and Ministry</h3>

<p>When he was released from prison, he returned to his home village of Vitendwe. While there, he told his brother that, “what I was doing was not good before God. My heart is willing to serve God Almighty.” Acknowledging the news, his wife was amazed, and she asked her husband if he was really called by God. With a remorseful heart Hamilton told her that, “if it is God who has called me and if I will do this on behalf of God, then I will make it.” [6] His newfound calling did not please everyone. His mother had been hoping he might take a second wife to have more children and regretted that this would now not be possible. His drinking friends were also disappointed. At his local church congregation there was initially resistance to the proposal to put his name forward as a potential ministerial candidate. Finally, his name was accepted. [7] In 1986, Hamilton enrolled at Livingstonia Theological College where he studied theology for two years.</p>

<p>On completion of his course, he was ordained and posted to Kasowa congregation in Karonga. This was a very large congregation with 28 prayer houses (outstations), with most church members being Ngonde by ethnicity. Hamilton stayed in Kasowa for 8 years, riding his bicycle from one prayer house to the next. Additionally, he was responsible for the neighboring Ngerenge congregation as they had no pastor. While at Kasowa he discovered his passion for building and oversaw the construction of a large church, as well as completing improvements to the buildings of numerous prayer houses. [8]</p>

<p>In 1993, when he was transferred to Njuyu station in Mzimba district, he noted that the presbytery was lacking an office. He turned his attention to constructing one, which was opened in 1995 by the Synod General Secretary Overton Mazunda. [9] Working now among the Ngoni people he built a new church at Kanyawayi. He also acquired a plot in Mzuzu and built a house for the presbytery so that they could generate funds from rentals. [10] When he was transferred to Bandawe on the shores of Lake Malawi in 1999, he built a new church, as the existing one could not accommodate the growing congregation. He did the same again when he was transferred to Kalikumbi congregation in Loudon Presbytery in the hills of Mzimba, the new church proving to be a venue where many people gave their lives to God. [11] In 2011 Hamilton was transferred to Hewe congregation in his home district of Rumphi, from where he retired. Even as he aged, his passion for building was undimmed and he built a beautiful pulpit in the church of his home congregation, Luviri CCAP in Nyika Presbytery.</p>

<p>As a minister, Hamilton was cherished because of the quality of his pastoral care. He regularly visited his church members, teaching and encouraging them in their homes without dwelling on their weaknesses. He was able to guide those who were in emotional turmoil and established friendships with the drunkards in his parishes. He accepted them just as they were, in order to bring them back to God. Many of them repented and became prominent church members. He knew how to handle a congregation. Where there was need for discipline, he was able to bring the necessary correction. [12] People loved him because of his transparent goodness.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he met some challenging times in his ministry. When he was serving at Njuyu there was a leadership struggle. Some people plotted to kill him by arranging for a Women’s Guild member to poison his food. He believed that God protected him by prompting him to refrain from eating the food that was served, choosing instead to eat with the Men’s Guild outside the church. After some time, the food prepared for the minister changed color and people knew that it was poisoned. On being questioned, the woman who had prepared the food confessed that she had been sent to poison Hamilton. [14] This incident was an exception to the rule, since he normally enjoyed peaceful relationships in the congregations where he served.</p>

<h3 id="emphasis-on-stewardship-creation-and-generous-living">Emphasis on Stewardship, Creation, and Generous Living</h3>

<p>Hamilton was a highly effective preacher, delivering convincing messages. His sermons at funerals were especially well appreciated. A particular emphasis in his preaching was stewardship. Wherever he served, people learned about Christian giving and how to care for God’s creation. His preaching was demonstrated in his generous way of life and his church members learned about the joy of giving themselves and their resources to God. The authenticity of his repentance from his old life and the commitment with which he served in ministry made a deep impression on many people. His favorite hymn was the Tumbuka translation of Psalm 121: <em>Tindinuskirenge maso yane mula m’mapiri kuchanya, nikovwilika naimwe</em> (I lift up my eyes to the hills, my help comes from the Lord). [13]</p>

<p>When he was about to die, he informed his children that any funds contributed to assist with his burial should be given to the church for building work. People were amazed to learn that his passion to serve God by constructing buildings continued until his last breath. [15] On July 14, 2024, Hamilton died due to diabetes and high blood pressure. He was buried in his home village at Luviri CCAP Congregation. He is remembered as a devoted pastor, a constant source of comfort, a teacher of stewardship, an unfailing source of help when needed, and a man who constructed church buildings to the glory of God. His works live after him.</p>
