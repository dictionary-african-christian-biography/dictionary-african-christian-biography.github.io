        <h3 id="early-life-and-education">Early Life and Education</h3>

<p>Moses Ochwo Madile was born in 1938 in a little-known village called Mwelo near the main regional town of Tororo in eastern Uganda. Moses was an only child of the union between his father and mother; for, shortly after his birth, his parents separated. He was raised by his father’s second wife, who treated him as if one of her own, along with her other children. Moses grew up as an immensely disciplined child who was given to education. He went through Uganda’s rigorous education system passing through all stages of the school system.</p>

<p>In his time, the education institutions in Uganda were encouraged by the government to monitor the academic performance of students and offer them guidance on how to choose career paths. Moses was interested in becoming a high school (pre-university level) teacher. He developed a liking for the sciences and majored in Biology. He secured admission into Kyambogo Teacher Training College, then one of Uganda’s most prestigious teacher training institutions before it was upgraded to a university, where he graduated with a Diploma in Education to teach Biology. He was recruited by the Ministry of Education and assigned to Nabumali High School, one of Uganda’s early schools that were established at the turn of the 20th century by missionaries of the Church Missionary Society (CMS), a body affiliated to the Anglican Church in the United Kingdom. [1]</p>

<h3 id="involvement-with-scripture-union-the-balokole-movement-and-music">Involvement with Scripture Union, the Balokole Movement, and Music</h3>

<p>As a young man teaching at Nabumali High School, Moses Ochwo Madile became an active member of the Uganda Christian Scripture Union’s local fraternity, which was largely comprised of the school’s students and others from nearby institutions. The fraternity, which professed to be of “born again” Christians, was supervised by a group of teaching staff which included Moses, and they too professed to be “born again” Christians. In essence, this “born again” group was part of the “Balokole Movement,” which was part of the early 20th century East African revival. In Uganda it was called the Balokole Movement because <em>Balokole</em> is a Luganda word that roughly translates as “the Saved Ones.” [2]</p>

<p>Some of the prominent members of the Balokole Movement were personalities of high standing, such as Archbishop Janan Jakayo Luwum, [3] who was martyred by Uganda’s military ruler General Idi Amin in 1977. Others included the earlier evangelist Apolo Kivebulaya, [4] who died in 1933 and was possibly one of the harbingers of the revival movement; Bishop Festo Kivengere, [5] of the Church of Uganda Diocese of Kigezi; the Reverend Canon Yesero Tebba Olowo, [6] of the Church of Uganda; and many others. Some of these, especially the Reverend Canon Olowo, in whose parish Moses’ home village fell, had much influence on him. Moses used to regularly visit the Reverend Olowo and would also help to conduct youth church services during school holidays. [7]</p>

<p>At Nabumali High School, Moses became one of the main pillars of the local chapter of the Uganda Scripture Union. This included leading members in a number of fellowship activities, such as Bible studies, and sometimes taking the pulpit to preach, with the school’s chapel as the center of activities. Gifted in music and particularly the guitar, Moses composed songs and led Christian youth in outreach ministries around the country. He was one of the young Christian men who were instrumental in introducing modern musical instruments other than the piano and organ into worship in church. During school holidays, he and other Christian leaders organized Christian youth conferences, known in those days as Christian Youth Conventions. These gatherings would last an entire week, were usually held in a specific boarding school, and would be held rotationally from one region of the country to another. [8]</p>

<h3 id="partnership-with-evangelist-dr-joseph-joe-kayo-and-founding-of-deliverance-church">Partnership with Evangelist Dr. Joseph (Joe) Kayo and Founding of Deliverance Church</h3>

<p>In 1967, Moses Ochwo Madile met a young charismatic preacher from Kenya called Joseph Kayo, whom he invited to preach at Nabumali High School. [9] The Evangelist Dr. Joseph (Joe) Kayo, [10] as he later became known, had a huge impact not only on Moses but also many in Uganda. Through the ministry of Moses Ochwo Madile and Joseph Kayo, a number of young men and women became “born again” as well; with some of them, such the Reverend Dr. Stephen Mung’oma and his wife Rachael (both alumni of Nabumali High School), and many others, becoming preachers and leaders themselves in the wider evangelistic movement, leading many more to Christ.</p>

<p>Through Moses’ work in those early days, seeds of a new Christian revival were already being sown in Uganda. Organizations such as the Deliverance Church was started by young Christian men and women including Moses, Joseph Kayo, and others. It began as a fellowship prayer group in Moses’ staff house in Nabumali High School, [11] and later evolved into what was known as Young Ambassadors Fellowship, with a declared mission to preach the Gospel of Jesus Christ. As its membership expanded and as students completed their high school training and moved to universities, particularly Makerere University and Kyambogo Teacher Training Institute (now part of Kyambogo University), all based in Uganda’s capital Kampala, the operational base of the Young Ambassadors Fellowship (YAF) also shifted to Kampala.</p>

<p>In 1971, the YAF transformed itself into the Deliverance Church, a name that the group took from the biblical messages of Isaiah 61:1 and Luke 4:18, focusing on preaching deliverance to captives and healing the broken-hearted. [12] Later, Deliverance Church was to play a significant role in the spread of the gospel of Christ, especially among young people in Uganda. During the difficult days of General Idi Amin’s brutal rule in the 1970s, it also helped steer the work of the church in Uganda. To date, the results of the ministry of Moses Ochwo Madile and Joseph Kayo can be seen in the continuing work of the Deliverance Church and other Christian organizations in Uganda.</p>

<h3 id="from-teaching-to-full-time-ministry">From Teaching to Full-time Ministry</h3>

<p>Moses later stepped down from the teaching service and became a full-time ordained minister in the Baptist Church in Uganda. For a while he was based in Uganda’s second largest city, Jinja, where he was one of the principal pastors. He later moved to London, England, to pursue further studies in theology before returning to his base in Jinja. After a while, Moses relocated to Kampala, where he continued ministering at St. Andrew’s Church of Uganda in the Bukoto suburb. While at St. Andrew’s Church, Moses was instrumental in the introduction and leading of a dedicated English language service. Until then, Sunday services at St. Andrew’s Church of Uganda were conducted primarily in the local Luganda language. He later extended this to St. Peter’s Church of Uganda and St. John’s Church of Uganda, respectively, thereby playing a key role in expanding participation among the local communities in worship and the work of the church.</p>

<h3 id="family-and-friends">Family and Friends</h3>

<p>Moses married Rose Ochwo Madile, whom he met at Nabumali High School. They had two children, Emmanuel and Joshua. Despite financial hardships and personal struggles, Moses continued in the service of the church, mentoring many more young people struggling to find their way in the Christian faith. During a visit to his home in Kampala in 2016, he declared to this author: “I am still a ‘born again’ Christian. I hope that you are also still one.” Moses suffered a stroke shortly thereafter. He passed away in March 2020 at his home in Jinja town after he contracted what was suspected to have been COVID 19. He was 82. Paying tribute to Moses, one of his close friends, Mr. Clive Lewis, former fellow teacher and Christian leader at Nabumali High School, wrote the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>MOSES OCHWO – a brief memoir: In the five years from 1969 to the end of 1973, Moses Ochwo and I were teaching colleagues at Nabumali High School. We were also close friends and ‘brothers in arms’, although our weapons were not guns but guitars, music and the Gospel. When I arrived at Nabumali, I was assigned a somewhat dilapidated staff house next to the one occupied by Moses. We soon became friends, and it was mainly through him that I was able to develop friendships with other Ugandans. ‘Expatriates’ (as we were often called) were treated with undeserved deference, and it could be difficult to bridge the gap between <em>bazungu</em> [Europeans] and locals. Moses’ friendship made that process, for me, not just possible but natural. We were both young bachelors in our twenties, and, despite our different backgrounds, we found much in common – not least our concerns about finding a suitable marriage partner! However, my fondest memories are about our shared love of music making in the service of the Gospel. Let me recall one typical scene: I am behind the wheel of my ever-reliable Volkswagen Beetle, and in the front passenger seat Moses Ochwo is seated. He is holding our two acoustic guitars. In the back seat are squeezed two - or even three! - students (plus drums), our ‘backing group’ for a Sunday visit to a Scripture Union group in a nearby school. We are going to tell the story, with accompanying songs, of a young man who goes to Kampala to live the high life – a life which nearly destroys him. The story is entitled ‘The City Kid’. [13] Moses was an enthusiastic exponent of the Christian music that I was composing at that time, including ‘The City Kid’. He was a true encourager, as well as being a lively and enthusiastic teacher and Gospel preacher. Although I returned to the U.K. in 1974, we never lost contact and our friendship has been sustained through the decades, even during recent times when Moses has faced various struggles. He will be much missed, but we can rejoice in his music, his ministry and his mentorship of many young people finding their way in the Christian faith. Thank you, Moses, and may you now rest in peace. Clive Lewis. [14]</p>

<p>Moses Ochwo Madile was laid to rest at his home in Abweli Village, near Tororo town, in eastern Uganda.</p>
