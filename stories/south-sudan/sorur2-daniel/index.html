<p>Daniel Sorur, a former slave who  converted to Christianity, became the first Dinka to be ordained a Catholic  priest. He was destined for a brilliant career in the Catholic missionary  movement in Africa at the end of the  nineteenth century. The great hope of his Comboni missionary mentors was that  he would be the agent for the evangelization of his people and other black  Africans. Unfortunately, poor health undermined and curtailed his activities,  eventually cutting short his life before he could fulfill his promise.</p>

<p><strong>Growing up in Wen de Meren, South Sudan</strong></p>

<p>Daniel Sorur was  born Farim Den[g] in 1859 or 1860 in a homestead he called Wen de Meren in the  Bahr al-Ghazal province of the Egyptian Sudan (now the country of South Sudan).  He was a member of the Jur, one of the Dinka groups  then occupying the western bank of the White Nile  and the southern side of the Bahr al-Arab River that borders on southern Kordofan  province. [1]</p>

<p>Farim’s name means “the saved one”  and it was given to him because he was born on a day when the “Arabs” attacked  the Dinka. [2]</p>

<p>His father Piok Den[g] died in a  hunting accident in 1868 when Farim was perhaps eight or nine, and following  the Dinka custom of levirate marriage, his mother Aquid married Piok’s older  brother, Akhol. [3] Farim’s older (and only) half-brother Kog died a year later  (1869), making him the nuclear family’s sole surviving son. He had three  sisters and a foster sister, the daughter of a poor woman who had been taken in  by the Den[g] family some years earlier and had been adopted when her mother  died. </p>

<p>Farim’s family were chiefly  pastoralists who raised cattle and sheep and moved regularly with other clan  members across the Bahr al-Ghazal border with southern Kordofan, planting crops  when there was time to harvest them. Their farming and grazing patterns  inevitably brought them into conflict with the Shilluk, the Nuer, and the  Baqqara, resulting in regular loss of lives and livestock. Later, as the  Turco-Egyptian government moved into southern Sudan,  the Dinka became subject to raids by the Egyptian army and <em>jallaba</em>,  petty traders from the northern Sudan  who operated on their own or as agents of the government in quest of slaves and  other booty. From the 1840s onward, the sale of slaves found a steady market in  El Obeid, the capital of Kordofan province, in Khartoum,  Upper Egypt, Cairo, and Jidda, particularly male and female children  and young women who were wanted for domestic labor and also as slave-wives. The <em>jallaba</em> and the Baqqara eventually worked hand in hand, proving a  constant menace to the Dinka. In response the Dinka developed a variety of  tactics to defend themselves against these groups, just as they had  done to defend themselves against their traditional enemies, the Shilluk.</p>

<p>Despite losing his father when he  was eight and his elder brother when he was nine, and despite periodic  illnesses, occasional cattle-thieving, and the constant need to seek fresh  pastureland for the herds, Farim considered the early years of his life  uneventful. In an unpublished manuscript he wrote about his people, “Qual e il  mio paese nativo,” which includes valuable autobiographical information, he  recounts several early adventures leading to his gradual understanding of the  world. One recounts a journey with a cohort of Dinka herders to the farther  reaches of the Bahr   al-Ghazal River  where they encountered the Baggara. He was startled to realize that not all  people were as black as the Dinka were. They bartered spears, grain, and sheep  for metals and metal-based goods. [4] On another occasion, Farim remembered how  the Nile rose unexpectedly high, with the result  that their home was flooded. This was not considered a disaster however, since  his family escaped harm but it also drew attention to the vagaries of Dinka life  on the great river. When he was older, he was sent to work with a related clan  that needed young men to look after the cattle. This was a rare opportunity to  be among young men of his age group for a number of months. In his discussion  of “marriage” in this same manuscript (which was omitted from the official  autobiographical work, <em>Memorie</em>, that the missionaries published—see  below), it seems that Farim had been promised to a young woman by his mother  and step-father and wore a ring in his ear as a sign of his engagement. [5] Of  these early memories and of his recollection of Dinka religion and customs in  general, the twentieth-century activist priest Marc Nikkel considered Farim’s  account sketchy and at times erroneous, and laid part of the blame on the fact  that his life with his people ended when he was so young. [6] However, the  “Qual e mio paese nativo” manuscript was first worked on in 1883, when Farim was  twenty-three or twenty-four, and it is clear from letters he wrote at this time  that he was keen to discuss Dinka language and customs with the few European  authorities who knew of his people, and we can assume that he retained an  active memory of his people and early years. [7]</p>

<p><strong>Enslaved</strong></p>

<p>Farim was captured by Baqqara in  1871, when he was eleven or twelve. Thus began a brutal new chapter in his  life, resulting in a journey he could never have imagined as a young boy. What  he relates of his capture is typical of the slave narratives that the Comboni  missionaries collected and published in their house organs, the* Annali  dall’Associazione del  Buon Pastore* and its successor <em>La Nigrizia</em>, [8] but the particular  details are nonetheless deeply moving.</p>

<p>The family’s house was located not  far from the river, and herdsmen and tillers used to cross it in order to tend  the land on the opposite bank. They were also not far from the dry grasslands  that Farim calls “desert” in the <em>Memorie</em>, and in times of emergency, men  and women and their children used to flee into it in order to escape slave  raiders. In the months leading up to their enslavement, the Dinka had escaped  or fought off several marauding groups.</p>

<p>The day of his capture, the men  folk of Farim’s family were away tending the herd and the women planting a crop  when they were surprised by Baqqara and <em>jallaba</em> on horseback and quickly  surrounded. Fearing enslavement and being separated from her children, Aquid,  whom Farim portrays as a strong and fierce woman, gathered the girls around her  and put up a struggle. However, she was wounded by her attacker and all of them  were soon captured. In a panic, Farim ran into the grasslands and climbed up a  tree to hide. However, the tree was already sheltering another Dinka boy, and  both were spotted by the Baqqara horseman who was pursuing the fugitives. They  were brought back to the slave encampment where Farim and his mother caught  sight of each other. Though hoping to stay together, Aquid and her daughters  wound up with different masters, and eventually were separated, never to be  seen again. Aquid knew the slavers didn’t like keeping mother and children  together, but she persuaded her slaver to trade one of his young captives to  Farim’s slaver in exchange for her son—without letting him know they were  related—so that at least the two of them could face the bleak future of  enslavement together. [9]</p>

<p>After an arduous trip from the Bahr  al-Ghazal region, during which additional Dinka clans (the Twic, among them)  were attacked and enslaved, Farim and Aquid arrived in El   Obeid, the capital of Kordofan. They were left in the compound of  Assemani (Uthman), an agent for the principal slaver who was named Abdallahi.  Assemani treated him and his mother relatively well. [10] It was Assemani who  gave him a new name, “Surur” (Sorur), which means happiness.  It was a common name given to slaves at the  time.</p>

<p>Farim remained enslaved for two  years. He served his master in a variety of capacities—shepherd, doorman,  shopkeeper, tailor,—and was often entrusted with special duties. Assemani and  Abdallahi decided to return to the South Sudan  on a new slaving expedition, and Aquid volunteered to go as the cook on the  chance she might find her daughters and bring them back. Assemani didn’t agree  with this idea, and so both she and Farim remained in the camp. However,  shortly before Assemani and Abdallahi were due to return, Farim or Sorur (as he  was now called), was accused of a minor crime and threatened with a harsh  punishment. He feared for his life and decided to escape, either into the  grasslands to die or to the newly established Comboni mission house in El Obeid where he understood that slaves were given  refuge. (He also feared he might be eaten, as this was rumored about whites  among Sudanese slaves.) He opted to take his chances with the missionaries. He  was welcomed into the house by Mons.  Daniel Comboni, who was then in El Obeid and  later repeatedly protected Farim against his former owner. In a dramatic scene,  Assemani brought Aquid to the mission in an effort to persuade him to return to  servitude. Farim refused, and Aquid angrily turned her back on him, saying in  harsh terms that she would never see him again. Later Farim heard that she had  tried to escape, had been caught, and then punished by being sent to work under  harsh conditions in the fields outside Assemani’s encampment. Indeed, he never  saw her again and no doubt their last scene together could never be forgotten. These  events occurred in late 1873 and represented in dramatic terms the break  between his traditional life and his new identity as a modern man and a  Christian.</p>

<p><strong>At Mission House in El Obeid, Khartoum  and then Europe</strong></p>

<p>In his published autobiography,  Farim or Sorur relates how he started learning Italian and Arabic at the Catholic  mission in El Obeid, and also began catechism  classes. He was baptized by Mons.  Comboni in 1874. Comboni had become his mentor and had given him his name; henceforth  he was known as Daniel[e] Sorur. He studied for a further year at the Khartoum Mission  School, and then was selected in 1876,  along with Arturo Morzal [Mursal], an ex-slave from Dar Fur, to be sent to Verona for further  studies. Comboni petitioned Pope Pius IX asking that both be admitted to the  Collegium Urbanum, Rome,  and his request was granted; both boys entered the college in 1877.  Sorur studied philosophy and religion in a  course of studies that would lead ultimately to the priesthood; Arturo dropped  out, opting instead to study medicine.  </p>

<p>While he was still in Rome, Sorur began to work  on a manuscript about the Dinka and their customs, and one of his several  unpublished manuscripts, “Qual il mio paese nativo” (What is my Native Country),  was written at this time (ca 1881).  Part  of this work was included in his autobiography, later serialized in <em>La  Nigrizia</em> in 1887-88, and part was translated into German and published in  1888 and then republished in 1890 and 1900. [11] It was also during the period  in Rome that he began another work called “Le  pene dei negri schiavi in Africa” (The Travails of Black Slaves in Africa) in which he developed his ideas about the  salvation of black people through the instrument of Christianity. In it he also  equates Islam with modern slavery and the strangulation of the African spirit,  and opines that his black brethren will never progress unless they escape Islam  and embrace Christianity. The editing of his work was finished around 1885.  [12] By the end of his formal studies, Sorur had not only shown considerable  intellectual capacities, but was also fluent in Italian, French, German and  English. He had established himself as a spokesman for the conversion of  Africans to Christianity, a role for him that the Comboni mission fathers must fervently  have sought. </p>

<p>In 1883, however, Sorur fell  seriously ill [13] and was sent to recuperate in the warm and dry climate of  Cairo, where the Comboni mission had constructed a new church and two mission  schools in the new and fashionable quarter of the city known as Ismailia. After  seven months there, he was deemed well enough to finish his studies at the Jesuit University  in Beirut,  which he did in 1886. In the summer he went to Ghazir, a village in the  Lebanese mountains, to undertake further studies in Arabic and to teach French  and Italian.</p>

<p><strong>Return to Egypt  and a Short Sojourn in Sudan</strong></p>

<p>Later in 1886, he returned to Cairo, where he was ordained the following spring by  Bishop Francesco Sogaro in a ceremony at the Sacred  Heart Church  in downtown Cairo.  According to his autobiography, his ordination caused jubilation among the  city’s Catholics and Sudanese, being the first “black” to become a priest. [14]  This was the time when Cairo’s  ex-slave and trans-Saharan African populations were perhaps at their height.  Also, it was a time when many other Sudanese had sought refuge there from the  newly installed Mahdist government in Omdurman.  [15]</p>

<p>After his ordination, Sorur’s  memoir (<em>Memorie</em>) was serialized in five issues of the mission bulletin <em>La  Nigrizia</em>. Its purpose was clearly to introduce him to a wider audience,  including the European financial supporters of the Comboni mission in Africa.  It  contains dark references to struggles between the Dinka, the Shilluk, the  Baggara, and the slavers, be they itinerant merchants from the north (<em>jallaba</em>)  or Turco-Egyptian government officials, but also the narrative of his dramatic  escape from slavery, his mother’s doom-laden rejection, and his decision to  embrace a life with the Christians over a life under Islamic rule. This latter part  was the message that the missionaries wished to impart to the thousands of  non-Muslim Sudanese who had been forced into slavery in the nineteenth century,  and to the mission’s backers who supported the crusade against slavery and  their efforts to Christianize Africa.</p>

<p>With his studies now completed, Sorur  was kept busy in Cairo  teaching Arabic to Sudanese and other Africans while the Comboni Fathers  decided what to do with him next. [16] Trained as an evangelical priest, they  wanted him to begin work in the Sudan.  However, at this time only Sawakin and the eastern Red Sea  coast remained free of Mahdist control. In late 1887 he was posted there and  put in charge of its mission school. Although his stay was short, it was a  highly eventful time. The port city was besieged by Mahdist forces, and the  siege was not lifted until the end of 1888. Sorur’s role during the siege was  later praised in the mission literature. In a letter to Bishop Sogaro in Cairo,  Sorur reports on the Battle of Sawakin on December 20, 1887 in which Sudanese  battalions fought off an attack by Uthman Digna, and how as a consequence he  was unable to send in his monthly account since he had not yet paid the grocer,  the baker, or the butcher. [17] His normal duties during the year involved  teaching catechism and Arabic to young Christian adepts (probably ex-slaves),  and greeting people traveling down the Red Sea.  During this time he met two American priests from South Bend, Indiana,  and later corresponded with Father Daniel Hudson of Notre Dame. In an extant  letter to him, he recalled that it was “twenty years” since his conversion to  Christianity (actually it was only fourteen) and that he regretted the fact  that his mother and sisters remained “Muslim.” [18]</p>

<p><strong>Fund-Raising Sojourn in Europe</strong></p>

<p>Sorur spent only eighteen months in  Sudan.  The mission in Verona seems to have realized his  value as the spokesman for the Combonis’ work in Africa and they brought him  back to Europe in 1889 to participate in a  major fund-raising trip for the mission being undertaken by Bishop Franz Xavier  Geyer. The aim of the journey was to raise money for the Central African  Mission’s institutions in Cairo (which by now  had expanded to new grounds located on the island of Zamalek)  and for the construction of churches in Sawakin and Helwan. Fluent in French as  well as in Italian, German, and English, Sorur enjoyed great success as a  speaker and proved especially popular in Austria  and Germany.  His ability in languages and his gentle demeanor won him many friends. Many  Europeans had never seen a black person before, and were often stunned by his  appearance. [19] Later Sorur joined for a short period Cardinal Lavigerie’s  ardent crusade in Europe against slavery in Muslim northern Africa.</p>

<p>Sorur must often have lectured on  slavery in Africa. In addition to his work <em>Le  Pene dei negri schiavi</em> in Africa,   <em>he found  time to write a longer manuscript called</em> Lo stato reale dei Negri (The  Real Condition of the Blacks). It is a serious effort to discuss the religious  and social ideas of Africans in various parts of the world in which they lived.  It was turned over to be translated into  German and to be published but in fact it never was. [20]</p>

<p><strong>Return to Cairo  and Final Years</strong></p>

<p>Ill-health was probably the reason  for his return to Cairo in 1891, where Sorur  remained during the final period of his life, teaching at the mission schools  in Cairo and  later Helwan, where most of his students were Egyptians or sons of Europeans. Helwan  had become famous as a spa, and no doubt the baths and the dry climate helped  Sorur cope with his illness. Biographies written about him do not suggest that  he was involved in the education in Zamalek of ex-slaves or other Sudanese in Cairo at the end of the  nineteenth century where the Comboni Institute taught useful trades and catechism.  Rather, the surviving photographs of him at their boys’ school in Helwan picture  him with young Egyptian students. Sudan remained closed off until it  was reconquered by an Anglo-Egyptian force in 1898. But by that time, his  health was failing him.</p>

<p>Sorur died in Cairo  at the Abbasiyya Hospital on January 11, 1900. [21]  He is believed to be buried in the common  grave of the Comboni brothers and sisters in Helwan, but in fact his name is  not mentioned in the plaque in the mausoleum. A brilliant career as an evangelical  among his people eluded him. After he died, the Comboni missionaries were able  to return to the Sudan,  and in 1930, his autobiography was translated into English, [22] though never  published. Clearly the missionaries believed the truncated career of this  unusual man deserved to resonate with their new converts. [23]</p>
