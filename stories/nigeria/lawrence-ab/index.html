<strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Abiodun  Babatunde Lawrence joined the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&amp;S) <em>Aladura</em> Movement in 1926 and soon became  one of the prominent leaders. This movement had started in Lagos in 1925 as one  of the Yoruba *Aladura *or “Owners of  Prayer” movements. It began through the ministry of Moses Orimolade Tunolase  with the assistance of a young and energetic woman, Christianah Abiodun  Akinsowon. During the first four years the movement gained prominence and  attracted elites within the Lagos community. However, from 1929 schisms  threatened the unity of the movement as the principal leaders parted ways in  succession. Lawrence, later nicknamed “Major” Lawrence by Orimolade, was one of  the leaders who broke away and established his own version of the C&amp;S  movement, named the Holy Flock of Christ (HFC) in 1932.</p>

<p><strong>Birth and Early  Life</strong></p>

<p>Lawrence’s  father originally came from Ikole Ekiti, but was raised by Brazilians in the  Brazilian quarter in Lagos, Nigeria. His mother, who originally came from  Ijebu, was a popular yam seller. Lawrence was born in Lagos on December 25, 1898.  His names <em>Abiodun</em> and <em>Babatunde</em> are cognomens, what the Yoruba  usually call <em>oruko amutorunwa</em> (distinguishing  epithets that a child brings with him or her into the world). <em>Abiodun</em> is a combination of two words <em>Abi</em> (to be born) and <em>Odun</em> (festival).  Usually, a name such as <em>Abiodun</em> is given  to a child who is born during festive periods. The combination of the names <em>Abiodun</em> and <em>Babatunde</em> was unique. The traditional name <em>Abiodun</em> suggests that he was not only born during a festive period,  but also on the actual day of a festival—Christmas Day 1898. The second one,* Babatunde,* also has a traditional connotation. <em>Baba</em> in Yoruba means father, while <em>tunde</em> literarily means “he has come again,” thus <em>Babatunde</em> means “father has come again.”  Such a name is usually given to a male child who is born immediately after the  death of his paternal grandfather. The belief is that the deceased grandfather  has returned to the family, a practice in keeping with the Yoruba belief in  re-incarnation.</p>

<p>It  is believed that Lawrence’s parents received a revelation or prediction while he  was an infant that he would grow up to be a leader followed by many people. As  he grew up, he developed the habit of looking at issues from a spiritual point  of view. His peers reported that they felt that the spirit of God  was upon the young boy.</p>

<p>He  attended St. Peter’s Primary School, Faji, Lagos, where he excelled and  out-performed many of his peers and classmates. Very early in his life, people  identified him as a man who loved to be a peacemaker, a mediator, a reconciler,  and one who was eager to render help and assistance in whatever way possible to  members of his family, neighbors, peers and colleagues. He was also known for  being philanthropic.</p>

<p><strong>Christian  Involvement</strong></p>

<p>Lawrence  became a committed Christian while he was a member at St. Peter’s Cathedral, a  church within the Anglican Communion in Ita Faji, Lagos. Those who knew him described  him as “worshipping the Lord with all his heart, mind and soul.” He was also  known as a bold, serious, and enthusiastic member of the congregation. He  served as a “sideman” or usher, an executive member of the Young Men’s  Christian League, an executive member of the Young Men’s Christian Union, and a  Sunday School teacher. He  was involved in prison visitation and  ministration to inmates, particularly by helping prepare prisoners to re-integrate  society after their release and discharge.</p>

<p>Lawrence   studied printing at the Church Missionary Society (CMS) Printing Press and  worked at the Railway Printing Press, Ebute Metta, until February 1934 when he  resigned to become a full-time pastor. His colleagues at the CMS Bookshop and  Printing Press, Ogunmefu and E. J. Fasoro, who were also his neighbors,  observed a special call of God in young Lawrence’s life, and his potential to  be a steward in “the vineyard of God.” Although young and enthusiastic, many  observed that his humility and God’s anointing enabled him to know how to work  closely in the company of elders.</p>

<p><strong>Joining the C&amp;S  Movement</strong></p>

<p>By  what some believe was divine intervention, Elder W. A. Akinyemi, the father of  Dr. W. A. M. Akinyemi, persuaded him to join the C&amp;S movement in Lagos in  1926. The C&amp;S movement grew out of the ministry of Moses Orimolade Tunolase  in collaboration with Christianah Abiodun Akinsowon, a young, beautiful and  charismatic lady (later Mrs. Emmanuel).[1] Orimolade and Christianah Abiodun ministered  together as a father and daughter team. Christianah Abiodun offered visions and  predictions while Orimolade conducted healing sessions and performed miracles.  It was unbelievable for Lawrence’s colleagues,  friends, and mates to see  him join what they thought was such a pedestrian movement meant only for  peasants. Lawrence was highly intelligent and a respected young man in society.</p>

<p>Soon  Orimolade appointed eminent leaders to help attend to those who needed prayers  and healing because alone he could no longer handle everything. He called them “the  Praying Band.”[2] Lawrence’s qualities showed up immediately in the C&amp;S, and  Orimolade picked him to be one of “the Praying Band.” Members of the movement believed  the Band was divinely chosen because it was the group in charge of spiritual  matters. The group was handpicked by Orimolade after a session of fasting and  praying. He picked seven, replicating the example of the disciples who  appointed seven men of good report for material distribution in the first  church.[3] However, Band members held spiritual positions, assisting Orimolade in  all matters of special fasting, prayers, and spiritual warfare. Led by E. A.  Davies, they became the inner core of the original <em>Aladura</em> or C&amp;S Movement. Along with Orimolade, these seven  leaders became responsible for the spiritual well-being and progress of the C&amp;S.[4]</p>

<p>Soon  Lawrence enjoyed a close relationship with Orimolade who made Lawrence the head  of the “visioners” and “seers.” It was Orimolade himself who added the title “Major”  to Lawrence’s name, just has he had added the title “Captain” to Christianah  Abiodun’s name. Therefore, members of the movement always referred to Lawrence  as “Major Abiodun Babatunde Lawrence” even though he had never been in the  military.Lawrence was acknowledged  as a leader among his peers. Followers believed the Lord was  with him and used him mightily to support his leaders. He was an unparalleled  visionary within the movement. Under  Orimolade and Davies, Lawrence, as Spiritual Leader, carried out the following:  Spiritual preparation, guidance and leadership of the movement, revival and  convention preparations, oversight of the visioners, administration,  interpretation of visions and dreams, prayer warfare in healing ministrations, and  words of exhortations to members. Delivered, weekly, monthly, and annually, members  believed his words were divine messages. Therefore, even though Lawrence may  not be described as a co-founder with Orimolade of the C&amp;S Movement  as was Christianah  Abiodun, he was certainly Orimolade’s right-hand man.</p>

<p><strong>Separation from  the C&amp;S Movement</strong></p>

<p>In  spite of Lawrence’s position within the hierarchy of the C&amp;S Movement, over  time visions and signs appeared to point Lawrence to a more prominent calling. In  October 1926, Lawrence had a prophetic revelation. But he kept it to himself  and did not reveal it until it was actualized in 1932 after the establishment  of the  Holy Flock of Christ Organization. Second, in 1928, many people reported seeing a star  over the residence of Lawrence on 49 Kakawa Street, Lagos. The star was seen as  such a mighty sign and indication among C&amp;S members that Orimolade himself  had to go to see it. Third, many people claimed that they observed  either the same star,  or a similar star, in the same place at 10:30 pm on December 12, 1933, shortly  after the establishment of the HFC. Lawrence’s supporters agreed that the stars  were signs and an indication of divine attestation, testimony, and approval of  the work that Lawrence was doing within the C&amp;S movement under Orimolade  and would continue to do in future.</p>

<p>In  1928, shortly after the anniversary of the Convention/Revival of the C&amp;S,  which had gone well, disagreement suddenly arose over matters arising within  the movement. It is not very clear what the genuine root of the discord was,  but it was severe enough to cause the first schism. Regrettably the  misunderstanding and the rancor between the two founders of the C&amp;S  Society, Orimolade and Christianah Abiodun, grew worse and became more  acrimonious. Efforts by some elders in the church to settle the misunderstanding  met with failure. In early 1929, Orimolade, with supporters on each side  fuelling the conflict, wrote a letter to Christianah Abiodun, advising her to  form her own separate society. It was probably not her  desire to break  away but the actions of her followers, which she did nothing to control,  suggested otherwise. Whatever the  cause, the split was  complete and, at least for that time, irreversible.</p>

<p>That  year, Christianah Abiodun established her own society, another variation of the  C&amp;S <em>Aladura</em> movement, which she  named The Cherubim and Seraphim Society. Orimolade’s party in which Lawrence  remained for the time being, opted for the name The Eternal Sacred Order of  Cherubim and Seraphim Society.</p>

<p>Three  days after Christianah Abiodun established her branch of the church, Orimolade  sent the seven leaders of the Praying Band to Okun Ibeju to pray on matters that  had led to the disagreements  that split the  Movement. The seven moved out as requested by Orimolade to Okun Ibeju, a beach on the Atlantic Ocean, about ten miles from  Lagos toward Epe. It was a quiet location where there were no  distractions–an ideal solitary location for prayer. One of the prayer points  requested by Orimolade was prayer for Lawrence’s safety, potentially a ruse to  win Lawrence to Orimolade’s side over the matters in contention.</p>

<p>C&amp;S  members believed that God sent the following messages through Lawrence in a  vision at that prayer retreat:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Do not believe  in sweet talk. Do not desist from praying night and day against dangers that  threaten the body. Do not look for help from people; only look up to God who  only can empower. Carry the cross now and be ready to tell Moses Orimolade and  all the members the truth because you can only dwell with the Lord by being  always truthful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The  divine messages were communicated to Orimolade, but he chose not to heed them. Therefore,  another rift developed within the <em>Aladura</em> Movement. The seven members of the Praying Band, the spiritual leadership group  of the original C&amp;S Movement departed from Orimolade and formed the Holy  Cherubim and Seraphim Aladura Movement (HC&amp;SAM) under the leadership and  chairmanship of Davies  with Lawrence as the Spiritual Leader. However, this  breakaway body could not cohere for long. Another split occurred  which finally  separated Lawrence from the stump of Orimolade’s group led by Davies.[5]</p>

<p>Lawrence  eventually became discouraged and disenchanted because the messages he uttered  were ignored and rejected by some members. He said that people preferred to  turn to fads or fashion. In Lawrence’s view, the leaders of the movement had  abandoned holiness and adopted rather shameful and unchristian practices. He  contended that the love of the flesh had taken the place of the spiritual and  the holy.</p>

<p><strong>Founding of the  Holy Flock of Christ Organization</strong></p>

<p>Because  of these deviations, Lawrence decided to call on God for direction. On February  20, 1932, he went on his annual prayer tour to Olorunkole Hill, near Ibadan, Oyo State. He considered two main  prayer points: that all nations should be born again spiritually and that  spiritual worship should not become a thing of the past in the world. As soon  as he returned from the tour, he went straight to Ibeju beach in Lagos and went  on a Lenten fast for forty days during the Lent of 1932.</p>

<p>On  his return from Ibeju beach, he went to the HC&amp;SAM to deliver his message  after the Wednesday service on April 13, 1932. His message was that the Lord wanted  him to disassociate himself from the HC&amp;SAM. He was direct, absolute, and  determined. Many people became despondent and sad when they heard his message.  As might be expected, some people condemned him, as a “selfish and  self-centered man” who was not satisfied with his position. Others declared  that they would go with him wherever he went. Three leaders from the HC&amp;SAM  decided to follow him: C. B. Olumuyiwa, D. K. Idowu and J. O. Adefope. Many of  the prominent members of the HC&amp;SAM decided to follow Lawrence because they  saw the Spirit of God on him. They saw him as an instrument in the “vineyard of  God.” This was the beginning of the Holy Flock of Christ (HFC) with its  emphasis on mystery and the leading of the Spirit. Lawrence described the  founding of the HFC in his first report:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We prayed for 36  days. On the dawn of May 15, 1932, after the Morning Prayer, 321 names were  voluntarily added to the register of this Holy Flock of Christ. In the evening  prayer meeting, the Almighty God surrounded us with His rainbow. Two women went  into labor in the morning and three christening/naming ceremonies were  performed. In the morning service of May 15, 1932, the name of this  organization was given from above as HOLY FLOCK OF CHRIST. The glory sign  appeared on children, adult males and females. The children’s and females’ glory  sign was so much. Forty days after the Pentecost day, the liturgy, rules and  regulations to be used in this organization were given to us from above, which  we are using now presently in the Flock.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The  Lagos Branch of the HFC met in the houses of the four former leaders of the HC&amp;SAM  who joined Lawrence’s group. It was necessary to ensure that the first branch  was solidly founded and healthy before venturing out to form others. Saturday  night vigil was particularly popular. When members of the HC&amp;SAM saw the  glory of God being manifested in the HFC, they sought to join. On August 13,  1941, their request was formally brought to Lawrence. He responded that for their  request to be considered, they had to agree to some corrections in doctrines in  some areas, such as vision, prayers and praying, dreams and dreamers, and the  roles of spiritual workers within the HC&amp;SAM. The HC&amp;SAM did not  formally reply to the corrected points, so Lawrence did not give them a formal  reply. He insisted that the message of God was that the HFC should remain  separate and distinct from any <em>Aladura</em> movement. Mixing with or combining with other churches was out of the question.</p>

<p>With  the HFC formally established, from April 13 to May 14, 1932, daily prayer was  held in Lawrence’s house at 49 Kakawa Street focusing on three prayer points: all  souls should become spiritually born-again, true spiritual worship should not  become a thing of the past in the four corners of the world, and Jesus Christ  should breathe on worshippers afresh according to His promises in the Gospel. Spiritually-minded  people made it a point of duty to attend the daily morning prayers and reported  visible blessings of the Holy Spirit in their daily businesses and affairs. The  prayers culminated in the name “Holy Flock of Christ” being revealed and  affirmed for the new organization at the morning service that was held in  Campus Square. After the service, everybody present retired to Lawrence’s house  to register their names in the new HFC Organization. The spiritual message to  all members that evening was that the HFC would be made a covenant to the world  if all members were spiritually and heavenly minded.</p>

<p><strong>Growth of the HFC</strong></p>

<p>On  August 29, 1932, Lawrence, in his capacity as Spiritual Head of the HFC organization,  took the group on their first evangelical tour. The tour started with Mr. J. O.  Osinbowale, and their first port of call was Epe. From there, they moved  through Atijere to Ibadan, Fiditi, and southward to Odogbolu and Okitipupa, all  in the Yoruba-speaking southwest region of Nigeria. Later he was joined on the  tour by some lady members: Emily Ogunlana, Elizabeth Adefope, E. O. Olumuyiwa,  Joanna Talabi and Dorcas Talabi. Witnesses attested to great works of healing,  ministration and exhortation. The report of the first evangelical tour was  prepared when the team returned to Lagos on October 17, 1932. It was read by  Mr. Osinbowale to the joy and satisfaction of all members.</p>

<p>It  was during the first evangelical tour that Senior Spiritual Elder C. B.  Olumuyiwa started the process of purchasing a permanent site to house the HFC. Everyone  searched earnestly and eventually the group felt that the Lord was leading them  to 45 Okepopo Street in the city of Lagos. Meanwhile, on May 21, 1933, Lawrence,  in his capacity as the Spiritual Leader of the organization, appointed officers  and trustees.[6] Then on September 29, 1933, all the officers and members of  the HFC moved to the new location of their “House of Prayer,” which remains the  headquarters of the organization.</p>

<p>With  a permanent “House of Prayer” and a fairly extensive work of leading and  administering the growing work of the HFC, on February 13, 1934, Lawrence  decided to move into the HFC’s permanent accommodation where he became a  full-time minister, evangelist, and church planter. For almost ten years he  lived there under various conditions. In total, he planted fourteen churches in  the Lagos, Ijebu, and Oyo areas. His followers described him as being steadfast  in prayer and fasting, courageous, loving, generous, and hospitable. They say  he exemplified what Christian leadership should be—self-abandoning, righteous,  empathetic and self-sacrificing. Through his actions, he became a father for  the fatherless, hope for the hopeless, help for the helpless, and a provider of  jobs for the jobless. Lawrence was always calm, cool, serene, calculating,  unimpulsive, gentle, humble, forgiving, and patient. He was described as a  giver who never counted the cost of giving. Above all, the members of the HFC  remember him as a prayer warrior and a shepherd who administrated  the church well.</p>

<p><strong>The HFC after  Lawrence</strong></p>

<p>Lawrence  moved back to his own house at 18 Oke Suna Street, Lagos, on October 11, 1943  when his illness became terminal. He died on October 19, 1943. Lawrence was  survived by two children, a son and a daughter, both now deceased. His son was  called Babatunde or “Tunde” and his daughter Oluyinka or “Yinka.” Both took an active  interest in the affairs of the HFC and married in the church. Tunde rose up in  the hierarchy to become Senior Spiritual Elder. His children survived him. Only  two of these children played notable roles in the affairs of the HFC. Tunde’s late  son was in the HFC’s musical band and a member of the choir. Yinka’s children  are very involved in HFC affairs. Femi is an Elder and he pastors the HFC’s  branch in Maryland, USA. He is well known among pastors and evangelists in the  United States. Yinka’s daughter, Feyi, is a visioner and a worker among women  in one of the branches in Lagos State.</p>

<p>Between  1943 and 2015, the leadership of the HFC rested on the shoulders of seven  different men in succession. After Lawrence, Prophet Emmanuel Adeseye was the <em>Alakoso</em> or “Coordinator” from 1943 to 1946.  He was followed by Spiritual Elder D. K. Idowu, Coordinator (1946-1955);  Spiritual Leader Most Ven. Joseph Olukoya Adefope (1955-1977); Ven. S. I.  Ogunfowora, Coordinator, (1979-1980); Most. Ven. Moses O. Osisanya (1981-1983);  Spiritual Leader Most Ven. Joseph Oluremi Osinbowale (1984-2012); and Most.  Ven. Josiah Adetola Adefope (2013-2015).</p>

<p>The  two Adefopes who have led the church are brothers of the same parentage. The  older Adefope, Joseph O., who left Orimolade with Lawrence, was much older in  age than his brother Josiah. The older Adefope was a powerful preacher and  visioner. With good administrative skills and a sense of humor, he was able to  pilot the affairs of the HFC for decades. The present Spiritual Leader, Josiah  Adetola Adefope, is a “chip off the old block.” A seasoned civil servant like  his brother, he has a good hold on the HFC. To his credit, he delegates his  duties to able assistants but oversees quite effectively the general  administration of the church. Venerable J. O. Babalola is the  General-Secretary.</p>

<p>At  the time of the writing of this biography in January 2015, the HFC, founded by Lawrence,   remains a strong and spiritually dynamic  but low-key praying and worshipping band organization, headquartered at 45  Okepopo Street, Lagos. There are about seventy-five branches worldwide, mainly  in Ogun, Osun, Lagos, Kogi and Edo States of Nigeria. There are also branches  in Philadelphia and Maryland in the United States of America and in Israel. The  HFC is a blend between modern day Anglican /Methodist /Baptist liturgy and style  and modern Pentecostal churches. The main thing the HFC has in common with other <em>Aladura</em> congregations is the wearing  of white garments in most, not all, of their services. Members do not put on the  white garments in their various homes and wear them all day. Instead they put  them on during services and prayer meetings. It is a church that believes in  prophecy and members see visions, dreams and hear voices which they relay to  the other members of the church.</p>

<p>The HFC is over 80 years old today. Within the <em>Aladura</em> movement, it is a  distinguished member of the Organization of African Independent Churches (AICs).</p>

<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>1.<strong>Brief biography of Orimolade.</strong>Orimolade  was born about 1879 in Ikare, Akoko in present day Ondo State. He was a prince  but also born crippled in one leg, because of the circumstances surrounding his  birth. It is believed that before he started his ministry, he received a vision  that instructed him to bathe in the water of a nearby flowing stream. He obeyed  and partially recovered from his disability, but he limped throughout the rest  of his life.</p>

<p>Although  Christianity was new in the area during Orimolade’s formative years, he was one  of the early converts and adopted the name “Moses” on his baptism into the  Methodist Church. As he grew up, he became more prayerful, spending much time  in the study of the Bible. In 1916 he set out from his native town of Ikare  preaching the gospel in and around Yorubaland, the Middle Belt, and the Northern  part of Nigeria. Between 1916 and 1924, the record indicates that Orimolade  visited Kaba, Ilorin, Kaduna, Jos, Zaria and Kano.</p>

<p>Orimolade  returned to Lagos in 1924 and decided to settle in Lagos where he stayed with  the sexton of Holy Trinity Church, Ebute-Ero. He was soon known for his  powerful prayers and healing sessions, for which he was nicknamed <em>Baba Aladura</em>, “the Praying Father.” As  he went around preaching, he did not initially attempt to establish a church  but he directed converts to the church of their choice nearest to them. That  notwithstanding, people filed up to his home for prayers.</p>

<p>Christianah  Abiodun Akinsowon, later nicknamed “Captain” Christianah Abiodun Emmanuel,  joined Orimolade’s team in 1925 after she had been in trance for some days, and  was restored after Ormiolade prayed for her. Soon afterwards, they developed a  strong father and daughter relationship in their work. Orimolade was forty-six  years old and Christianah Abiodun was eighteen. It was a powerful combination.  Scores of people came for prayers and divine guidance through visions and  predictions given by Abiodun while Orimolade conducted healing sessions and  performed miracles. The group increased by leaps and bounds and, after several  revelations, adopted the name Cherubim and Seraphim (C&amp;S) Society. The name  of the church was registered in November 1925 with seventy disciples, as they  were called, forty-five men and twenty-five women. It was symbolic of the seventy  disciples that Jesus sent out in twos in the Bible.</p>

    <p>In order to satisfy the yearnings for both work and recognition, Orimolade  constituted another group of elders and called them “Patriarchs.” While the  Praying Band was in charge of spiritual matters the Patriarchs took charge of  administration. Other groups followed. But one that was very significant was  “the Army of Salvation” composed of loyal and energetic young men who performed  security and safety functions as guards and ushers on important occasions and  processions.</p>

    <p>Acts 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The seven members of the Praying Band were: Lawrence, E. A. Davies (father of  lawyer H. Q. Davies), H. A. Phillips, C. B. Olumuyiwa, D. K. Idowu, J. A.  Phillips, and J. O. Adefope who joined Lawrence when he founded the Holy Flock  of Christ (HFC).<em>**</em></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Orimolade was heartbroken and shattered by the factionalization and break-up of  the C&amp;S Movement. He withdrew from Lagos and moved initially to Osholake  Street in Ebute-Metta, and later to Ojokoro near Agege where he died on October  19, 1933.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lawrence appointed the following officials within the HFC: Mr. C. B. Olumuyiwa,  Senior Spiritual Elder (SSE); D. K Idowu, J. O Adefope, L. I. Gabriel, J.  Ayo-Coker, and M. A. Thomas, Spiritual Elders (SE); T. A. Oyesanya, E. O.  Ayodele, S. I. Ogunfowora, J. O. Fakeye, M. I. Oje, F. A. Okutade, M. O  Osisanya, J. O Onagoruwa, G. A. Martins, and J. O. Richards, Superintendents;  E. A. Macaulay, J. A. Abodunrin, James. O. Taiwo, Theophilus Akin, P. A.  Odutade, S. M. Odusanya, and S. S. Aiyelabola, Assistant Superintendents;  Samuel S. Cdumbu, Deacon; Ms. Sarian Fiyakola Taiwo, Deaconess.</p>
