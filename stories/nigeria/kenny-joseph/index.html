        <!-- CONTENT -->
        <p>Joseph Peter Kenny was a man of dual citizenship - an  American by birth and a Nigerian by naturalization. He would have celebrated  his 50 years as an ordained priest in 2013, 48 of which were spent in the  service of the Catholic Church of Nigeria. He was ordained a Catholic Priest of  the Order of the Preachers, otherwise known as the Dominicans, and sincerely  served Nigeria both within the Church and the intellectual circle until his  death on January 28, 2013.</p>

<p>Kenny was born in Chicago, USA, on January 12, 1936. His  grandparents came to the USA from Ireland, thus his parents were born in the  USA.  He studied at a Catholic Parochial  Primary School in Chicago and then went to the Archdiocesan Minor Seminary for  his secondary education. From there he proceeded to the Major Seminary of the  Chicago Archdiocese. Out of the aspiration to achieve a sound spiritual and  academic life, he discovered that for him the Dominican Order was the way to  go. Consequently, after two years in the Major Seminary, he was accepted by the  Dominicans and started his novitiate in 1956. He made his first profession of  vows in 1957 in Winona, Minnesota and his final vows in 1960 and was ordained a  priest in 1963.</p>

<p>He studied diligently during his formative years as a  Dominican and earned a Bachelor and Master of Arts Degrees in Philosophy from  the Aquinas Institute, River Forest, USA in 1959 and 1960 respectively. He also  earned a Master of Arts in Theology at the Aquinas Institute, Dubuque in 1964. Kenny  also had qualifications in Arabic and Islamic Studies. He obtained a Certificate  in the discipline at the Pontifical Institute of Arabic Studies in 1967, a  Diploma from the University of Tunis in 1967, and a Ph.D from the University of  Edinburgh in 1970. He had a very good academic formation, including learning the  Latin and Greek languages.</p>

<p>The Dominicans had arrived Nigeria in 1952. After settling  at Yaba, Lagos in the St. Dominic Parish, they were asked to go to take on the  work in the Sokoto Prefecture, which at that time was the Province of Sokoto,  and the Province of Katsina, of the then Northern Region of Nigeria. Kenny  arrived in Nigeria on November 13, 1964.   At the time he was not sure in which direction his life would go or  where his superior would send him when he spoke with Edward T. Lawson, the then  Prefect Apostolic of the Sokoto Prefecture, who eventually became Bishop Lawton  of Sokoto Diocese. Lawson understood that missionaries should have a good  knowledge of  Islam, given the fact that there were many Muslims in Nigeria and the importance of Sokoto and its Sultan. Consequently, after the study  of Arabic in Rome and Tunis, and having made some research in Cairo, Kenny went  for further studies at the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, for his Ph.D. He  returned to Nigeria in 1970 and his first assignment was in Malumfashi, in  Katsina Province. It was here he learned  Hausa. He then worked in  Sokoto for a number of years, before he was seconded to Ibadan in the  Southwestern part of Nigeria to assist in the academic work and to also help  develop the Dominican Institute there. He was thus one of the founding fathers  of the Dominican Institute, the Centre of Institutional Studies of the Nigeria Province  and he taught there all his life. Even after retiring from the University of  Ibadan he served as the Dean of Studies and Professor of the Dominican  Institute, Ibadan, Oyo state and up to the day of his death, he labored  earnestly for the realization of the Dominican University project of the  Province.</p>

<p>On being seconded to Ibadan, Kenny was also offered an  appointment to teach in the Department of Religious Studies, University of  Ibadan. He joined the services of the University in 1976 as Lecturer 1 and rose  to the position of Professor in 1994. He served the University for 22 years,  was the Head of Department of Religious Studies from 1995-1998 and represented  the Dean of the Faculty of Arts at different occassions. He bought the first  computer for the department in 1995. He retired from the University on September  30, 2001 to join the Dominican Institute fully. He was a Visiting Professor at  Les Facultes Catholiques de Kinshasha and Lecturer at SS. Peter and Paul Seminary  and Dominican Institute (1971-1979).</p>

<p>His contribution to the birth and subsequent development of  the Dominican Institute of Philosophy and Theology, Ibadan was monumental. In  fact, his contribution was so significant that for all practical purposes it could  be said that he earned the status of an “institution” of sorts at the  Dominican Institute (DI for short). Such is the case that not to know Joseph  Kenny was not to know the DI. He was wholly involved in all the efforts that  eventually made the DI what it is today.</p>

<p>Just like the 13th century Dominican St. Albert  the Great was versed and well known for his love of nature, Kenny was also very  much interested in the world of nature. He belonged to the Nigerian Field  Society (NFS) for many years. This organization is a national organization  founded in 1930 with branches in several cities across the country that depend  entirely on local interest and volunteer commitment. He volunteered his time,  which included working on their publication. He had a lively interest in  apiary work (bees) and helped the community to develop some 40 active hives,  which produced a lot of honey and contributed to the finances of the community. He was interested in trees, especially fruit trees  that are endemic in the equatorial region like Nigeria. He planted several  different species in the Ibadan community.</p>

<p>Virtually  everyone who speaks of Kenny eulogizes the virtues of the departed priest and  professor.  The Catholic Archbishop of  Ibadan Diocese, Felix Alaba Job, said that Kenny led a life worthy of emulation.  Talking about his simple lifestyle, Charles Ukwe, his next door neighbor for  nine years at the DI, said that Kenny rode a Honda motorcycle for several years  and was always in bathroom slippers, stressing that he only put on sandals when  travelling out of Ibadan or out of the country even as a professor. The late  professor was said to always wash his own clothes by himself. Kenny said his cassock  was always sewn by himself in order not to put the burden on the Dominican  Community, a situation he said always made his  different from the others.  Kenny was said not to be title crazy as he was so much at home with  everybody, including his students who fondly called him Alhaji and his friends  and admirers who referred to him as Avejoe.</p>

<p>Spiritually,  Kenny was said to be highly prayerful and committed to his vows as a priest.  Ukwe testified that, “Fr. Kenny didn’t allow the things of the world to disturb  his vows. All his salary at the University of Ibadan was always donated to the  Dominican Community and he depended on whatever was given to him. He was down  to earth, could eat anything called food, he loved this nation, and gave it his  service for a lifetime. Ukwe finally admonished the congregation to be of good  cheers despite the demise of the late priest, who he said accepted the call,  persevered in the vocation, and touched many lives.</p>

<p>The Catholic Bishop Conference of Nigeria (CBCN) via Gabriel Abegunrin, spoke very highly of Kenny. He described him as a  consultant to the Conference on inter-religious matters and who, apart from  Bishop Alaba Job, touched the lives of everybody from Warri-Lagos, adding that  he was not just a teacher, but a friend, a father, a person who lived  productively, one to emulate, and one whose name will remain in the heart of  many for a very long time.  Another  Catholic priest in the person of Felix Ajakaiye described Kenny as a true child  of God, a man of God, a wonderful priest and one who worked his faith as well  as his prayers. Speaking further, Ajakaiye thanked God that he knew and also  served under Kenny, for he was at a time his altar servant. According to him, “he  [Kenny] taught me to be industrous and to be a lover of books”.</p>

<p>Academically, he was an erudite scholar and a Catholic priest  who sought religious harmony by becoming an Islamic and Arabic Scholar, while  teaching the discipline for 22 years at the Department of Religious Studies,  University of Ibadan, Nigeria. He was not just a scholar, but perhaps had one of  the biggest Islamic libraries in Nigeria.   He was a genius, a sound researcher and one who was faithful to his  work.  Testifying to his ingenuity, his  colleagues at the University of Ibadan said he was a model in the  Christian-Muslim discourse in Africa and an ardent promoter of inter-religious  dialogue. Thus, he was closely associated with the Department of Arabic and  Islamic Studies, University of Ibadan. As an expert in Islamic Studies he  served in various capacities on various commissions for Inter-Religious Dialogue  for the Catholic Bishops Conference of Nigeria and Association of Episcopal  Conference of West Africa. He was proficient in thirteen languages: English, Latin,  Greek, Hebrew, Italian, French, German, Spanish, Hausa, Arabic, Yoruba, Dutch,  and Portuguese. He had several books and over 200 articles on various areas of theology  and philosophy, Thomism, metaphysics, liturgical music, Islam, inter-religious dialogue,  and various other social issues. He was a lover of liturgical music, especially the Gregorian  chants.</p>

<p>He was an eloquent preacher and missionary.  He remains one of the greatest intellectual  colossi of the Order of Preachers in the twenty-first century. He was a scholar  and a keen researcher who possessed a profound knowledge of the major issues in  almost all disciplines.  He was a  profitable resource person in matters of inter-religious dialogue, whose  numerous publications of books, journals and articles both on the electronic  and print media today constitute a gold mine. During his teaching career both  at the University of Ibadan and the DI, he never failed to encourage any  student in whom he noticed a spark of brilliance. He wanted to replicate his  intellectual prowess in his students. Indeed, he was simply a genius making  geniuses.</p>

<p>His manner of ministration was highly admirable. Whether he was  singing or speaking one could not help but admire the conviction in his tone.  He was ever punctual at masses. He was there just before prayer began and gone  soon as it was over. His relatively brisk and short masses and homiles won him  the name - “Father Sharp Sharp.”  He was  a brother, teacher, and mentor to many.</p>

<p>Before his final call home he was working on an  international conference that had a Lebanese delegation of Sunni, Shiites, and Christians  (both Orthodox and Catholic), which was intended to bring Muslim and Christian  thinkers together and to be held at the University of Ibadan, Ibadan, Nigeria.  Unfortunately, his illness prevented him from attending. He finally died  on January 28, 2013 after a brief illness.</p>
