        <p><strong>An Abridged Biography</strong></p>

<p>A  northern Nigeria proverb says “it is the patient that cooks a stone.” This  perhaps describes the life of  Baba Ezra Dikki. His patience with life,  his family, ministry, and every endeavor that the Lord placed in his hands was  legendary. Exact records do not exist, but Dikki was estimated to have been  born into the family of Dikki and Mandi, of the <em>Lelna</em> tribe, around 1928. He had the privilege of being born into  the family of Dikki, who was a first generation Christian in the village of  Senchi in Zuru Emirate of the then Sokoto Province. This province became North  Western state and later split into the present day Kebbi state of northern Nigeria.  Baba Ezra’s father Dikki wholeheartedly embraced Christianity in the early days  of the 20th Century. When the missionaries asked him to separate  from his second wife after his conversion, he did. Also, he was extremely  diligent to ensure that all his children accepted Christ, in an era when the  head of the family decided the direction of the family. Most of his children  became either pastors or evangelists.  </p>

<p>Although   Baba Ezra Dikki was among the youngest in the family, Elder Aaron Dazi  revealed in 2007, during the first UMCA Arewa District Heroes of Faith  ceremony, that Baba Ezra Dikki was the first indigene of Zuru to be ordained  as a reverend in the Arewa District of the United Missionary Church of Africa  (UMCA), which was initially known as the United Missionary Society (UMS).   Baba Ezra Dikki recorded in his diary that he accepted the Lord as his personal  Lord and savior in 1937, and because he totally embraced and committed his life  to Christ after conversion, he decided to go to Bible school to train and become  a pastor. He therefore went to Salka Bible School in the present day Niger  state in northern Nigeria in the early 1950s. After graduation, Dikki decided  to accept the call to be a missionary pastor instead of returning to his native  home area of Zuru. He was then posted to a newly planted UMCA church in Majinga  among the Kambari people of Niger state on April 15, 1957. Thus began his  pastoral missionary work among the Kambari people, a work that spanned about  twenty-four years. However, before we continue to discuss his family life and  ministry, it is important to give a synopsis of missionary work in Zuru land,  which is where Dikki was from, and is also where he came into contact with the  gospel.</p>

<p><strong>Missionary Work in C’lela  Land (Zuru Land)</strong></p>

<p>Paul  Ummel, a missionary, was the first to bring the gospel to the Zuru area, around  1925. He preached the gospel in <em>C’lela</em> land and went as far as the <em>Dukkawa</em> land of Darangi. Ummel could not go further to Rijau at that time because of  colonialist fraternization with Islam, which forbade missionaries from working  in Muslim areas. [1] Indeed, Islam benefited from colonialism  across Africa in similar ways. [2] First, Ummel spent time learning the  language, and thereafter started his ministry among the <em>Lelna</em> people. Ummel served under the supervision of Rev. Sherk who  was then the second UMS mission superintendent in Nigeria, the first having  been A. W. Banfield, who with his wife set foot on the shores of the river  Niger in October of 1905 in a Nupe settlement, to pioneer the mission work that  has now become the UMCA. [3]</p>

<p>It was  around this time that Dikki, along with his friend, the chief of Senchi, named Daniel  Dazi Senchi (Gomo), converted to Christianity, which then led  to the conversion of  Baba Ezra Dikki and his siblings. Conversion to  Christianity was not that easy for <em>Lelna</em> people  because of their attachment to their culture and the worship of <em>mgila</em> (the traditional religion). Before  1943 only Zuru had a church, it was only after this that other churches came  into being, including that of Senchi. In 1946 Rev. Sloat became the UMS  Superintendent. It was during his time that a church was planted in Tungan  magajiya among the <em>Dukkawas</em> and work  on a hospital was begun by someone named Hunsberger and Pastor Mai Kyau. The  hospital was to play a huge role in the growth of Christianity, as the gospel  was preached every morning before the day’s operations started and in the wards  afterwards. The writer also experienced this practice as a young boy in primary  school until the government took over mission schools and hospitals in the  early 1970s. [4]</p>

<p><strong>The Family life of Rev.  Baba Ezra Dikki</strong></p>

<p>Baba Ezra Dikki married Arzumi Dorcas Bandi before going to Salka Bible School in  the early 1950s and she was his companion in ministry until his death on the July  9, 2011. It is known that great ministers of the gospel have, often not  consciously, neglected their families in the heat of ministry. A typical  example is Eli the priest in 1 Samuel. But this was not the case with  Dikki,  as this tribute given at his burial revealed: “He is a shining example of  discipline, humility, and service to God and family. He gave his all to the  family. He diligently labored over the lives of his children with the sole  object of their coming to embrace the faith.” [5] God granted him the reward for  his labor, and all nine of his biological children (Charles, Philemon, Benjamin,  Rebecca, Michael, Grace [deceased], Helen [deceased], Joy, and Mercy, and two  adopted children, John Tamaha and Alheri) came to know the Lord and committed to  the service of Christ.</p>

<p>Dikki was a man of vision, and he and his wife labored to send their children  to good Christian schools, even with inadequate funds. He refused to send his  children to the Native Authority schools (which were free) because he wanted  his children to have both Christian and secular education. Today, his nine  biological and two adopted children are all university graduates and Christians.  In view of the fact that the one shilling six pence pastor’s salary that was  paid then, and which could not feed his family for even two days, was  insufficient, he tried his hands at several things to meet the needs of his  children. He farmed corn, groundnuts, <em>bambara</em> nuts, onions, tomatoes, pepper, sugar cane, oranges, mangoes, etc. He even went  into soap making, sewing, and many other such trades just to train his children,  and he did this without neglecting his pastoral duties, because he would still  visit his congregation members from evening till late in the night. He did this  in addition to ground breaking missionary outreaches and church planting outings  to villages on foot or bicycle. When he eventually got a church started, he  continued to diligently carry out his ministry.</p>

<p>Although  he passed rapid results [exams] qualifying him for college abroad,  Dikki  sacrificed his hunger for further education, having concluded that doing so  would hinder the possibility that all of his children would receive a quality  education. Rev. (Dr.) Jacob Bawa Salka, the youngest in a joint UMTC class with  him, who went abroad to study and eventually became the national president of the  UMCA, wept openly about missing a dear elder brother who had encouraged him to  go for further studies. Today, as a legacy of his sacrifice, there is a  professor, a medical doctor, an architect, accountants, a pharmacist, an  administrator, and a marketer finally turned pastor, all of whom he prayed for.  The pastor graduated from graduate theological school on the day  Baba Ezra  Dikki was called home to glory. It is also significant that one of his sons is  at the forefront of translating the Bible into <em>C’lela</em> , his native language and that of the Zuru people, which was  one of his dreams. “Your memory will spur me to attain your dream of the Bible  in <em>C’lela,</em>” [6] his son Benjamin said,  as a confirmation. Presently, the New Testament in <em>C’lela,</em> barring any changes, is scheduled to be commissioned in the  month of April, 2012.</p>

<p>He  was not only passionate about his family but was also very passionate and  sympathetic towards the underprivileged. He and his wife assisted innumerable  needy people. For example, he adopted a sulking young man who walked into his  house one day, unable to go to school. He did this in spite of the burden of  his own children, and today that young man is a permanent secretary in Niger  state. A mother who had a vision for her first daughter but was unable to train  her pleaded with him to adopt her child and his tender heart could not resist  the additional burden. Today, she too is a graduate working with the biggest  broadcasting organization in Nigeria, and he was privileged to give her hand in  marriage before he died. There were several others whom he was not able to  accommodate in his house, but assisted them in their own homes. Through his  ministry many became laborers in the Lord’s vineyard. Indeed, this is only an  abridged story of his family life. It is not easy for the writer to forget an  experience in 1968, when we endured a cold night after missing the only available  transportation to a mission school, and how he went about looking for twigs to light  a fire to keep his son warm through the cold night. His children are eternally  grateful for his sacrifice; they are who they are today because he sacrificed.</p>

<p>One  great legacy that he left for his family therefore, is the lesson of sacrifice  and of welcome, of receiving everybody irrespective of their status. Several  times, as children, we had to sacrifice our meals to visitors, no matter how  hungry we were, without complaining, and to wait for another meal to be cooked.  We remember every Saturday, which was the Salka market day, when the pigmented  Kambaris would come in large numbers and eat all available food and find a  resting place. Many feared coming near them, from anxiety about being stained,  but many came to Christ because of this hospitality. He and his wife visited  their homes and ate with them, a task that was difficult even for his children.  The Kambaris, both Christians and non-Christians, wept openly on the day he  left Salka for Tungan Magajiya. Many wanted him to remain. Indeed, on the day  he was buried, many heard a weeping lady exclaim that “today fellowship has  died.”</p>

<p>Even  in his old age and retired,  Dikki would visit his children, grandchildren,  great grandchildren, former church members, those in spiritual need, and  friends, every day, to pray and encourage them. It was on one of his visits on  the fateful day of July 9, 2011, that he was knocked down by a motorcyclist and  went to be with the Lord. It is important to note this because ministry to the  family, as an important calling and just as crucial as going to the mission  field, has been greatly diminished in pursuit of ministry success.</p>

<p><strong>His Pastoral Life and  Ministry among the Kambari</strong></p>

<p>The  family life of a minister is a part of ministry that is often overlooked by  many great men of God, but family life was an integral part of  Dikki’s  core mission work. As mentioned above,  Dikki graduated from Salka Bible  School and was posted to Majinga on April 15, 1957, where he began his real  pastoral work among the Kambari people. Through evangelism and mission work  around the neighboring settlements that make up Majinga, he was able to grow  the church among the Kambari people. But after pastoring for three years, the  desire for further theological training took him to United Missionary  Theological College Ilorin (UMTC) around 1960, where he earned a Diploma in  Theology. Upon graduation he was posted briefly to pastor the UMCA Church in Yauri  for a couple of years, but the need to train more indigenous pastors  necessitated that he be reposted back to Salka as a missionary pastor and also  to teach in the vernacular Bible school, where he himself had graduated some  years before. This happened in October of 1966. He later became the first  indigenous principal of the Bible School and graduated many students who are still  serving today as pastors and are responsible for planting many UMCA churches.  These churches accounted for the growth of the denomination in the Arewa  District, which split into three districts years later, with Salka. That was  where he worked and assisted in planting several churches for over twenty years,  and it eventually became the headquarters of one of the created districts.</p>

<p>It  is among the Kambari people that his ministry blossomed, and UMCA became the  single largest denomination among the Kambari people for several decades. Combining  his duties as a pastor and teacher, and later as principal,  Dikki  organized his students into a missionary force. Many students under him started  their missionary work while they were still students. The writer remembers  vividly that every Saturday students would be assigned to villages where they  would preach the gospel as part of their curricular training. Wherever a  congregation had been established, students would be assigned to pastor there every  Sunday. When new students arrived, he would often be the one to take them to  such churches or mission fields either on foot or by bicycle, to introduce them  to the field. Thus, churches began to be planted in the surrounding villages: Kura,  Wando, Raba, Auna, etc. As a result, today many churches have been planted  around the entire Kambari land. Hundreds of Kambari Christians came in several  buses to attend  Dikki’s funeral when he was buried on July 16, 2011.</p>

<p>As  he began to grow old, he desired to serve nearer to home, so he was transferred  to pastor the Tungan Magajiya church about thirty kilometers away from Zuru in 1981.  There, he continued pastoral work and encouraging mission work among the  Dukkawas. It is from there that he voluntarily retired from pastoral work.   Dikki also had a passion for passing on the Christian legacy to younger  generations. Therefore, when the government of Niger state permitted the  teaching of Christian religious knowledge, and they were looking for people who  were qualified to teach, he was called out of retirement and offered the  appointment to teach at the Government Girls College in Tungan Magajiya. His  home was opened to many of them for counseling, and through him several gave  their lives to Christ, and testified at his funeral service. It was from this  job that he finally retired from active service and settled back in his home  town of Zuru.</p>

<p>Since  no-one is perfect, one can say that  Dikki’s weakness was his inability to  really put aside his disappointment and hurt when people he expected to have  high Christian standards failed. His expectation of perfect standards of  Christian behavior created a lot of tension with his wife, and sometimes his  children. </p>

<p><strong>Parting Shot</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps  the most fitting end to this abridged biography of  Baba Ezra Dikki is in  what Rev. Philemon Bawa, his former student now based in Canada, said in his  tribute entitled <em>A Tribute to the Man  Whose Heart was Always Broken by the Things that Break the Heart of Jesus,</em> part  of which states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Baba Ezra Dikki  was a friend to the outcast and hurting. Fearless witness of Christ’s saving  grace, passionate voice of God to his students at the Bible School, his church  and denomination; tender supporter of widows, the fatherless, and the poor. A  spiritual father to generations upon generations-from the destitute to the  powerful, from adults to teenagers, from loved ones to strangers from every  walk of life…For four decades he served the Lord faithfully in his preaching,  evangelistic, and teaching ministries, founding churches and leading outreaches  that have grown nationally and internationally. I said internationally without  exaggeration or reservation because myself, as one of his students at UMCA  Bible School Salka in the 1970s, and his church member, now working and pastoring  at Immanuel Fellowship (part of the Evangelical Missionary Church of Canada) and  by special grace of God, I have been touching lives for Christ…Baba Ezra Dikki  applied a creative, innovative spirit to ministry. He preached from anguish and  pain when Christianity was not a popular religion of choice in northern  Nigeria, believing God works through our weakness…The impact of his life is  immeasurable, not only in his preaching, teaching, evangelism, his simple  unsophisticated philosophy of life, but in his love, devotion, compassion, and  ability to stir faith for greater works of ministry. Now [it] is left for you  and I to follow his example because he left us a great legacy. This legacy is  not just for his biological children but to his spiritual children all over the  world. [7]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This writer concludes by saying, “your  passion, zeal, and dedication to the things of God infected all of us. No hero  of faith in the Bible was perfect, what distinguished them was the passion they  had for God and his things, in this you are truly a hero of faith.” [8] It is true  indeed as the great missionary Elliot said, “He is no fool who lets go of what he cannot  keep to gain what he cannot lose.” Baba Ezra Dikki did just that and  certainly he has gained that which he can never lose.</p>
