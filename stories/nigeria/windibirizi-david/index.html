<p>David  Longibiri Windibiziri grew up in the Lutheran Church of Christ (LCCN) in  Nigeria. He was baptized in the church, became a minister, and rose through the  ranks to become archbishop.</p>

<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>The  Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria was started by the Sudan United Mission. The  idea for the ministry emerged in a monthly periodical entitled <em>Sudan and the Regions Beyond</em> that was  published in 1889-1890. Dr. H. Grattan Guinness published the journal to stir  up interest in the Sudan which was closed to missionary efforts at the time. His  daughter, Lucy, was married to the German-born Briton, Dr. H. Karl W. Kumm who had  been a member of North Africa Mission. In North Africa Kumm had learned Arabic  and Hausa. Kumm and Lucy worked very hard to make the ideas of Dr. Guinness become  reality.</p>

<p>On  November 13, 1902, Kumm and a few other individuals in Sheffield, England  established a mission organization named Sudan Pioneer Mission (SPM)  Evangelical Churches. After Kumm consulted some of his contacts in Europe, the United  States, South Africa, and Australia, the name of the mission was changed from  SPM to Sudan United Mission (SUM) on June 15, 1904. Branches were then  established in Europe. Pastor Pedersen of Denmark who had heard Kumm speak at  the World Missionary Conference in Edinburgh in June 1910 established a Danish  Branch on November 22, 1911. After discussion with the British Branch of the  SUM, Pedersen became convinced that Yola (Nigeria) in the Sudan would be the sphere  of influence and missionary activity of the Danish branch.</p>

<p>The  journey of the church in Nigeria began with founder Dr. Niels Bronnum and his  wife, and accompanying missionaries Margaret C. Young and Ms. Dogner Rose. The  couple arrived in Nigeria and started their trip up the Niger River by boat on  February 18, 1913. While in the British Missionary Station in Rumasha, near Lokoja,  Margaret died of malaria shortly after giving birth to their first son, Holger,  in June 1913. Margaret was buried in Rumasha while Dogner Rose took their son  to Margaret’s family in Scotland. This allowed Bronnum and Rose to continue  their missionary journey to Numan, Bachamaland. They arrived on October 5,  1913. Bronnum obtained the necessary approval from the British Resident in Yola  to begin his missionary work. He built stations where unpaid Nigerian  evangelists settled to farm. They taught Christian principles in villages and  hamlets under Bronnum’s supervision.</p>

<p>The  first five indigenous pastors, namely Habila Alyedeilo. Ezra Gejere, Shall  Holma, Theodore Pwanahomo and Ahnuhu Jebbe, were ordained in 1948 after intensive  theological training. In 1955, the name of the church was changed from Sudan  United Mission to Lutheran Church of Christ in Sudan. Almost a year later, the  church became independent of Danish supervision and control and was renamed the  Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria. Before the Second World War, mission  stations had been opened in Numan, Lamurde, Guyuk, Shelleng, Dumne, Pella,  Dilli and Njoboliyo. More stations followed after the war. Numan became the  headquarters of the church and the seat of power for its pastors, teachers,  doctors, nurses, artisans, farmers and administrators.</p>

<p>This  was the situation when Bishop Akila Todi, the first African leader of the LCCN  and a Bachama by tribe, fell ill. Windibiziri was elected to take over in 1987  as bishop of the LCCN. When Bishop Akila Todi retired after leading the church  from 1960 to 1986, the LCCN was a one-diocese church based heavily in Numan,  the capital of Bachamaland.</p>

<p><strong>Birth and Early Life</strong></p>

<p>David  Lonkibiri Windibiziri was born around 1934 in Purokayo village, Guyuk Local  Government in Adamawa State. His cognomen, Lonkibiri, is a Kanakuru name which  means “born at night.” His father, Saghar, was Sarkin Dawakai (chief or owner  of many horses) in Guyuk. By local standards Saghar was wealthy as he owned many  horses and cattle. He was a Longuda by tribe and belonged to the kingmakers’  clan. He was often approached for advice and guidance by district officials and  local authorities concerning chieftaincy matters. David’s mother was Deremiya,  another Kanakuru name which means “surrounded by people.” She belonged to the  rainmakers’ clan. Thus David was born and bred in a traditional home environment  along with his siblings - one half-brother, Umaru Zalmadai, and one sister,  Sintiki. His mother had had seven children but only two of them survived—the  other one being a half-brother with a different father. She believed that her  children had been killed by witches except for David whom they could not kill  because he was a wizard. When David grew up, he told his mother repeatedly that  it was malaria that had killed his siblings but that always caused his mother to  laugh and ask how a mosquito bite could kill a human being.</p>

<p>Young  David followed his father and learned to imitate what he was doing. As a child,  he enjoyed swimming and riding on a corn stalk, pretending that it was a horse.  With the other boys, he went to the bush to hunt birds, rats, and bush fowls. During  the rainy season, they herded goats and sheep and enjoyed their milk. During  the dry season, they could let the goats and sheep roam free because the harvest  time had passed. This gave them free time to go hunting. Following local  custom, they wore armlets to prevent them from being bitten by snakes or being  harmed by evil spirits in the bush.</p>

<p>In  1947, a friend named Lonkiboni encouraged David Lonkibiri to join the baptismal  class held by the evangelist in Purokayo village. It took some time for David’s  father to agree to this because he thought it was a diversion that would make  his son lazy if he was pulled away from farming. Later David said that he was  grateful to his father and to God for this opportunity which led to his baptism  in November of 1949. This important event made him a member of the world’s  largest tribe, the tribe of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Education</strong></p>

<p>By  being baptized David had been diverted from the religion, trade and occupation  of his father. In 1951 and 1952, he attended Numan Training School which later  became Numan Teacher’s College. Upon finishing his primary education, he worked  for a short while in the mission bookshop. He would have preferred to go to the  evangelists’ school but for some reason, he pushed himself to attend Kofare  Agricultural School in Yola for one year instead. He continued in the School of  Agriculture (Samaru, Zaria) for another year and the School of Accountancy (also  in Zaria). Afterwards he joined the Numan Native Authority as an agricultural assistant.  Why was he drawn into agriculture rather than mission? David himself could not  answer the question except to say, “It was what God wanted and not necessarily  what my father or I wanted.”</p>

<p><strong>Marital Life</strong></p>

<p>At  the age of 21, David married Margaret, née Zufa Hassan. They had six children  who are all deeply rooted in Longuda traditions and culture and in ministry within  the LCCN. David and Zufa had a fulfilling marriage in which they found  happiness and joy and mutual love for each other. They were described as a  shining example of what a Christian marriage should be.[1]</p>

<p><strong>Christian Life and Ministry</strong></p>

<p>For  David Windibiziri, his service with the Numan Native Authority was both a  challenge and an opportunity to show his Christian character in real life  situations where his faith, beliefs and ethics were tested. It was an  opportunity to show what Christianity was all about to co-workers and peers, both  traditionalists and Muslims. It meant evangelizing at home and at work. David  believed that he could not live a dualistic life, separating the sacred and the  secular, that new Christians have to live their Christian witness everywhere. It  was not easy nor was it adequately appreciated among the people with whom they  lived and worked. But for David, there was no other way. Christianity was a  total way of life at home, at play and at work, in the church and in the office.</p>

<p>In  1958, David left the Agriculture Department and went to work in the Accounts  Department. After two years, he was sent to the Institute of Administration,  Zaria, to study secretarial work and accountancy for eighteen months. Upon  completion of his course, he was posted to Bauchi as an accountant. Here, he  began to feel a stronger attraction to the work of mission and evangelism. In  Bauchi, he told one of the pastors that he would like to go to the Theological  College of Northern Nigeria (TCNN). This desire took some time to materialize  because he did not easily find sponsors. He had no hesitation about committing  to this ministry even though he knew that government work held better prospects  and opportunities.</p>

<p>He  prayed constantly for someone to sponsor his theological training. God miraculously  provided a solution when the friend of a missionary who was a retired teacher  in Denmark agreed to pay his tuition and living expenses. David realized that  this was a direct answer to prayer but also a call to Christian ministry. In  1967 David left government work and entered TCCN where he completed his  theological studies in 1970. He was appointed pastor of Majamia Almasihu Jos in  January 1971and ordained in 1972. He worked in Jos for six years. He faced many  challenges but was able to surmount all of them. As a district pastor, he found  his earlier experience in local and regional services very helpful.</p>

<p>When  Guyuk Local Government was created in 1977, his people, the Longuda, invited  him to serve as councilor in the new local government. The public announcement  was made before he was contacted. It was difficult for him to say no. He said,  “I saw this as a temptation to leave my work as a pastor.” He accepted but for  only one term and he later returned to his job as a pastor. But as portfolio councilor  for Education and Social Welfare from 1977 to 1979, he left an indelible mark  on the lives of his people. When he returned to church work he was asked to  serve as secretary to the Rt. Rev. Akila Todi. He also doubled as  administrative secretary of the church for almost eighteen months, before leaving  to pursue further studies in the U.S.A. in 1983.</p>

<p>In  the U.S.A., he completed an M.A. in New Testament Theology at Luther North Western  Seminary. In the second year of his studies, his wife, Margaret, and their  youngest son, Hanim, joined him. The objective was to pursue a Doctor of  Ministry degree at Luther Seminary. He and his family had a favorable impact on  his colleagues in the program and on the entire seminary family.</p>

<p>When  David Windibiziri arrived at the Minneapolis airport, David Olson of the Minneapolis  Area Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (1987-2001) was there  to welcome him. He subsequently became his lifelong friend. He attested to  Windibirizi’s humility and confidence, his concern for the country, its  agriculture, and industry as well as international relations and  inter-religious dialogue and his vision to plant a million trees to counter the  advance of the desert.[2]</p>

<p>Upon  returning to Nigeria in September 1985, David Windibiziri was appointed pastor  in the new Federal Capital Territory of Abuja. His assignment was to establish  an LCCN congregation and church there to cater for the many LCCN members who  had moved to Abuja. He also discovered a great number of unreached peoples’  groups in the area which led him to develop an outreach ministry in Abuja and  Kontagora. David’s assignment in Abuja was a key period in his development as a  church leader. He was on this assignment when he was elected to succeed Bishop  Akila Todi.</p>

<p>In  addition to his studies in the U.S.A., he attended a three-month course in  Christian Mass Communication in Evangelism at Radio Voice of the Gospel in  Addis Ababa in 1976 and a church administration course for four years in Madras  (now Chenai), India, in 1981. He travelled internally and internationally to  attend conferences, seminars and workshops, lecturing and presenting papers.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership of LCCN</strong></p>

<p>Windibiziri  was consecrated bishop on February 22, 1987, thus becoming the second bishop of  the LCCN, the successor to Akila Todi (bishop from 1973 to 1986) who could not  continue due to poor health. It must be underlined that Todi was neither  tribalistic nor myopic about his successor. If he had been, it would not have  been easy for Windibiziri to succeed him.</p>

<p>Windibiziri  was an evangelist, a servant leader, a visionary and an innovator. As soon as  he became bishop, he took steps to outline necessary changes for modernizing  the church. Under his leadership, the LCCN expanded beyond the borders of Numan  and Adamawa State to become a national church with global contacts and  partnerships. He successfully launched training programs for pastors. In 1994  for the first time, seventy-seven pastors were ordained in one ceremony by  Windibiziri. He expanded the Bible College (Bronnum Lutheran Seminary) to a  degree awarding institution, affiliated to both Ahmadu Bello University and the  University of Jos.</p>

<p>Windibiziri’s  episcopate suffered from the disruptive church politics between the Bachama and  the Longuda members of the LCCN. Windibiziri was of the Longuda tribe. The  Longuda are the second major tribal group after the Bachama who were first  attracted to the Gospel when the Danish Sudan United Mission came to the area  in 1913. In the late 1960s, the Longuda people left the LCCN en masse and  joined the Baptist Church in protest over certain issues connected to the relationship  of the two tribes within the LCCN. Afterward only a few Longuda remained in the  Lutheran Church. As a result, the church came to be identified as a Bachama  church. It was no little surprise to most people when Windibiziri, a Longuda, became  bishop of the LCCN after Todi.[3]</p>

<p>Windibiziri  detested the idea of “African time,” that is, the practice of not being  punctual. He believed that time is a commodity that must not be wasted. He worked  to reform this attitude and to make everybody conscious of time.</p>

<p>Windibiziri  encouraged women to go into the ministry. Although women have played critical  roles for many years in the LCCN, they have not been accorded the attention and  positions they deserve. The theological orientation of the first missionaries was  an obstacle to the growth of the leadership of women and youth in the church.  According to Dr. Musa Gaiya, Windibiri’s predecessor Akila Todi “was very  conservative in his theology. For example, he opposed the ordination of women  and dancing worship. According to him, dancing in God’s house was a sin.”[4]</p>

<p>Rev.  Naomi Martin was the first LCCN female pastor ordained by Windibiziri in what  was considered a major reform that ensured the inclusion of women in church leadership  and administration. He had a strong vision for women’s leadership in the LCCN,  insisting that 40% of the leadership be made up of women according to his  friend Bishop David Olson. As of February 2015, there were thirty female  pastors in the LCCN. Naomi Martin has this to say about her experience:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>The time I was  ordained in 1996 was a hard time for the bishop and the church as there was  division in the LCCN. The bishop and others like him stood by me. They loved  and cared for me. They ensured that whatever the church was doing, I was  included. They also made sure they included women. The late bishop had the mind  to empower women. He sponsored me on workshops and programs abroad.[5]</p>

  <p>I remember when  we were at the Lutheran World Federation Forum in Geneva in October 1995; he  stood very firmly and declared that if there is any woman that is educated and  wants to be ordained, he would be the first to support her. There was  opposition among the other bishops, including the bishop of Ethiopia who vowed  that no woman would be ordained under his watch. Windibiziri’s position was,  however, well received and respected among many of the Western bishops.[6]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Windibiziri  was also a pioneer in providing leadership opportunities for the youth and  inviting their participation in the life of the church.</p>

<p>During  the 1980s and 1990s Muslims and Christians in the Northern Nigeria were locked  in a serious religious conflict. They disagreed about membership in the  Organization of Islamic Countries (OIC). Nigeria had been an observer for many  years and some northern states wanted to legislate Islamic Sharia Law. The  youth expressed increasingly radical views about Christian militancy and they  wanted revenge –“to retaliate, to kill and burn as they saw the Muslims doing.”  [7]</p>

<p>The  LCCN caught the vision of an Interfaith Dialogue Center where Christians and  Muslims could meet to dialogue on matters of mutual interest and to resolve  conflicts before they snowballed into violence. From November 2 to 6, 1993, an  initial conference was organized at Miango, Plateau State. Papers were  presented on the following topics: “Dialogue Between Christians and Muslims in  Nigeria: How Feasible?”; “The Theology of God’s Word from the Biblical and  Qur’anic Perspective”; and “The Influence of Politics on Religious Dialogue.”  Participants included Christian and Muslim leaders, some of which were women  and youth leaders. Windibiziri felt that it was a positive experience, with  frank and open discussions, and sometimes confrontations. Time was spent  identifying the historical, political, and economic causes of the conflicts. The  religious aspect of the conflicts was not neglected, especially since general  ignorance of each group’s beliefs played a role in creating tension and  bitterness when it bled into the media and public preaching. One of the  recommendations of the conference was to encourage the development of more  education programs for both Muslims and Christians so they could learn about  their own beliefs and that of their counterparts. This would help avoid  inflammatory statements and actions. [7]</p>

<p>The  first five conferences between 1995 and 2005 were sponsored by the LCCN through  the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). However, in accordance with  the principle of mutuality, the sixth conference was sponsored by the Muslim  Community through the Nigeria Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs (NSCIA).  Initially, issues of mutual concern in the area of religion and ethics were  discussed at the conferences such as “Secularism and Religious Pluralism” and  “the Importance of Moral Conscience in Improving Co-existence.” Later more  political issues were addressed such as “The Role of Religion in Sensitizing  Politics,” “The Role of Religion in Poverty Alleviation,” and “The Position and  Rights of Women in Society.” This effort, spearheaded by the LCCN under  Windibiziri’s leadership, was the forerunner of the Nigeria Inter-Religious  Council (NIREC) established nationally at the beginning of the 21st  century. The sultan of Sokoto, a Sarki Muslim, and the president of the Christian  Association of Nigeria are co-chairs of NIREC. The position of secretary is  filled alternately by a Christian or a Muslim. Windibiziri had this to say  about the effort:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>We soon found  that although we have been living together as neighbors for many years, there  is considerable ignorance about one another and our faiths. It has, therefore,  been very much a learning period. We have been able to analyze our situation  and background and already at the first conference we remarked that most of the  causes for crises and confrontations were not basically religious, but based on  historical, political, social and economic issues.”[8]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The  lessons that came out of this exercise and the interaction fostered confidence,  trust, and mutuality and built a relationship between the two communities,  particularly in Adamawa State. The achievement came amidst heavy criticisms of  Windibiziri who, nevertheless, continued to believe in the rightness of what he  was doing and forged ahead. The Youth Fellowship once criticized him with an  ominous prediction that while he was busy trying to foster good relationships  with the Muslims, he would one day wake up and find out that his church had  been burnt to ashes and all his members had deserted him.</p>

<p>Windibiziri  encouraged Christians to participate in politics. The early missionaries, in  accordance with their pietistic traditions and culture, were very conservative.  They did not allow their converts to participate in politics or to be involved  in profit-making ventures. But Windibiziri, because of his experience and  background, put an end to that. He fiercely encouraged LCCN members to  participate actively in politics and to undertake profitable and profit-making  commercial ventures. However, he insisted on clean politics and doing business  with integrity and honesty as good Christians who must be salt and light in the  world.</p>

<p>Windibiziri  also fostered the formation of international church partnerships. In 1988, the  ELCA reoriented its mission approach and emphasis along the lines of the  paradigm of “accompaniment.” This meant that the ELCA would actively seek to  partner with other congregations. Missionaries would be sent out to churches  under a new plan which encompassed accompaniment in mission. But this is how it  all happened:</p>
<blockquote>

  <p>It so happened  that the newly installed bishop of the Lutheran Church of Christ in Nigeria,  David Windibiziri, was a graduate of Luther Seminary, and his advisor, David  Olson, was elected to be the bishop of the Minneapolis Area Synod of the ELCA in  1989. In the following year, church leaders from Minneapolis visited Nigeria  and formalized their companion synod relations with the hopes of finding  congregations that would be willing to participate in the companion  congregation program.”[9]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From  that small beginning, church relationships have grown, and at the moment, the  Minneapolis Area Synod has partnered with fourteen congregations in the LCCN.[10]  This can be attributed to Windibiziri’s wise leadership and influence because  he saw the need to pursue such an agenda. His church partnership and outreach programs  were both national and international.</p>

<p>Another  area where Windibiziri brought his non-theological training and experience to bear  on his mission work as a church leader was in the area of agriculture. His  previous training in agriculture led him to focus his attention on tree  planting. As a result, he established the Agro-Forestry Department of the LCCN,  an effort that coincided with the overall plan of the Lutheran World Federation  at the time. Windibiziri was able to get support from the Lutheran World body  for his tree planting campaign, but unfortunately, it did not meet with  understanding from the grassroots.</p>

<p><strong>Personal Qualities</strong></p>

<p>When  it came to character, Windibiziri was a servant of God with tremendous patience  and humility. But at the same time, he was a determined and committed leader  and administrator. While Dr. Musa Gaiya (who wrote the biography of his  successor Akila Todi) may have mistaken his patience and humility for weakness,  he nevertheless acknowledged his success in the area of church growth because  it was so phenomenal. Even his adversaries respected him for his achievement in  creating five dioceses which helped the growth and outreach of the church. This  writer came into contact with Windibiziri’s disarming patience and enchanting  humility when Rev. Boniface Shenmi, one of the chaplain visitors to the prison  in Yola, invited him to mediate and reconcile the different groups in the LCCN.</p>

<p>The  growth of the church under Windibiziri was described as spectacular. Rev.  Lautai acknowledged that Windibiziri was the only one who talked about church  growth and expansion in the early days. In an interview with him, Lautai said that  Windibiziri’s most important achievement was, “church growth and church growth.”  He was both a great church leader and a great missionary. He was also described  as “a charmer and a disarmer.” His personality and appearance did not evoke  anger or dislike, no matter how you felt about him. He was a perfectionist to  the core. His catch-word was “Whatever you have to do, do it well.” He was a  family man and a great father to his children. At their golden marriage  anniversary in 2005, David and his wife recognized how blessed they were with their  seven children, their foster daughter Kuwi, and their nine grand-children. [11]</p>

<p>The  membership of the LCCN, which stood at about 1.7 million in 1987 when Windibiziri  took over as bishop, increased to almost 2.7 million by the time he retired as  the archbishop fifteen years later in 2002.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>From <em>Transition to Glory Funeral  Programme for David L. Windibiziri</em> (LCCN:2014).The tribute of David’s wife Margaret says it all:
    <blockquote>
      <p>Since the day we  got married 59 years ago, we were joined together under the promise that what  God has joined, no man should put asunder. But now death has separated us. It  pains me a lot that I was unable to take care of you when you were hospitalized.  This was not my making, but due to my ill-health. I am grateful to many people  that took care of you in different ways. May God bless them all. I am grateful  for many things that you have taught me. You taught me not to hold grudges  against anybody, but rather love everyone and be hospitable to any person that  comes my way. I am thankful for your words to me while I was in serious pain at  the hospital, when you said: “God is aware of all your pain and suffering, and  He will bring healing at his own time. And we are all in the hands of the  Lord.” These words have really comforted me knowing that your hope and trust is  in that Lord on your sick bed. <em>Baba</em>,  you are now at peace with all the problems and suffering of this world. I love  you, but God loves you most. Till I come to meet you at the feet of our Lord  Jesus Christ, Rest in Peace.</p>
    </blockquote>

  <li>Here is the original tribute by David Olson from a conflation of <em>Transition to Glory Funeral Programme</em> for David L. Windibiziri (LCCN: 2014) and Nicholas Pweddon, <em>A History of the Lutheran Church of Christ  in Nigeria,</em> published by the LCCN, Numan, Nigeria:
    <blockquote>
      <p>He arrived at  the Minneapolis airport the summer of 1983, a weary traveler amidst a sea of  humanity in Nigerian robes, to pursue his Doctor of Ministry degree at Luther  Seminary. There I was “uncle” to the twelve international churchmen enrolled;  he soon became their natural leader. Thus, these two Davids began a  quarter-century kinship. In 1986, I visited him in Nigeria two days after his  election as bishop, and one year before I was elected to the same office. God!  He has a sense of humor. We shared more and more. Nancy and Margaret became  dear friends on our next visit, and they returned the favor by staying in our  Minneapolis home for a 3-month study visit. It was personal, not formal. We  shared faith in Jesus, concerns for our people, our churches, our countries,  God’s world. At his consecration, echoing Bishop Akila Todi, my friend, said, “The  hunter’s son has become the second bishop.” But his model was the Good Shepherd,  Jesus Christ. He was pastor to the pastor-shepherds among LCCN’s many  shepherds. As I read over some of his many speeches over his fifteen years,  published in “Reflections and Presentations,” I recalled how grateful he was  for all those who had served before. We all stand on the shoulders of people  before us. This was David’s combined humility and confidence as your second bishop.  Every speech includes concern for your nation, for agriculture and commerce,  for neighboring countries and other religions. Talk of agro-forestry: he had a  vision to plant one million trees, to replenish and stop the desert’s erosion  for long after we’re gone.</p>

      <p>I rejoice that  LCCN continues to grow. In our much-divided and violent world, I give thanks  for David’s leadership in Muslim-Christian dialogue through the Interfaith  Dialogue Center. After meeting him at a Seminary, I was pleased to attend the  dedication of Bronnum Seminary, a church institution that will outlive us all.  He was also visionary in insisting that 40% of church leaders be women. As with  the Lutherans in America, there were times of tension, division, and parties at  odds. Your archbishop was always pastoral and respectful, not argumentative or  confrontational. Divisions come and go; some area healed. David was a healer. A  bishop who raised his own chickens might not know about money. Just the  opposite: he led many launchings successfully, raising millions of naira to  spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. I commend your church for accepting the archbishop’s  decision to create five dioceses and grow God’s gifts of leadership. We are  grateful for the smooth transition to the leading of Archbishop Nemuel, not  always easy in Africa or America. It is now thirteen years since I completed my  terms as bishop of the Minneapolis Area Synod. Bishops Craig Johnson and Ann  Svennungsen share your grief and our faith that the archbishop is among the  great cloud of heaven witnessing our tributes and continuing our ministries. In  my own heart, I have loved David as a brother. We spoke by phone days before  his death. Our families have been intertwined since Ar and Hanim studied in  America, and I was able to serve as their “uncle” here. Serving on a hospital  board here, we provided needed medical care for Margaret once and again. Today,  we rejoice that she is recovered at home in Guyuk, the Mama to your dear  departed Baba. Thanks be to God for Archbishop David Windibiziri.</p>

    <p>Details of the dispute: Under Todi’s episcopate, a Constitution Committee was  established to review and update the constitution of the LCCN. The committee  recommended, among other things, re-organizing the single diocese into six  dioceses. However, some individuals felt that the leadership of the church was  going to end up in the “wrong Longuda hands” and saw the division into multiple  dioceses as another means of weakening the Bachama hold on the church. They  orchestrated a dispute and division within the church. David pulled through the  reorganization with the majority of the church members with him. A small  splinter group which the LCCN called an “anti-diocese” moved out of the main  body and called itself a “non-diocese.” At that point, five bishops were  appointed for the five new dioceses and Windibiziri’s title was changed to  archbishop in 1995. Efforts to reconcile the two groups did not succeed. While  this writer was in prison in Yola in 1996-1997, with the permission of prison  authorities, he made an attempt to reconcile the two when the issue was brought  to him by one of the leaders but to no avail. When he became president, Bola  Ige and Jerry Gana also attempted to resolve the issue without success. The two  groups have since existed separately. It should be seen as the way of expanding  the Christian mission and work in the areas concerned.</p>
