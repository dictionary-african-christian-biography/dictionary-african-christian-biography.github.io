        <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>In  the mid-1960s, the Nigerian Pentecostal church movement was still very young  compared to the mission-initiated churches. At this time, the south-western  part of Nigeria witnessed the emergence of several freelance evangelistic  groups mainly of the Pentecostal tradition. These groups began with the work of  independent evangelists whose ministries extended throughout the country.  One such group was the Go Ye Evangelistic  Association, founded by the evangelist, Timothy Aremu Iyanda. This association was  one of the three most prominent evangelistic ministries in western Nigeria at  the time. The two others were the Glad Tidings Evangelistic Ministry, founded  by Isaac Adeolu Eniola, and the World Soul-Winning Evangelistic Group  (WOSEGRO), later renamed World Soul-Winning Evangelistic Ministry (WOSEM)  founded by Timothy Oluwole Obadare of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC). The Go  Ye Evangelistic Association was founded in 1965 with the name of T. A. Iyanda  Evangelistic Association.  Early in 1975  God led Iyanda to change the name of the association to Go Ye Evangelistic  Association and later the Go Ye Christ Mission International developed out of  the ministy. Through these two organs Timothy Iyanda sounded the trumpet of the  Gospel of Christ across the nation, preaching salvation and deliverance to all.</p>

<p><strong>Birth and Early Life</strong></p>

<p>Iyanda  was born on June 1, 1935, at Orile-Owu, Nigeria. Before his birth, his mother  had given birth to ten children who died at infancy.  In desperation, his father sought help from  various mediums. He went from one herbalist (a traditional healer) to another, seeking  occult solutions despite the fact that the old Iyanda was one of the founders  of the Baptist Church in Isanlu-Isin, in the present Kwara State of Nigeria  where he hailed from. The desperation and the intensity of the search  notwithstanding, the old man was utterly disappointed as none of the mediums  consulted were able to give any solution to his problem. However, this  challenge to which the occult could not offer solution, was surmounted through  a miracle from God in a revival prayer-meeting conducted by D.O. Babajide at the  Apostolic Church, Orile-Owu, and Timothy Aremu Iyanda was born.[1]</p>

<p>Timothy  Iyanda was enrolled in school by his father at Orile-Owu shortly after the  death of his mother.  At this time, much  value was not attached to western education in many communities especially  among the peasants as it was a luxury that many could not afford. It was a time  when the possession of large farm and the ability to manage it was a mark of  prominence and one of the reasons why Africans delighted in polygamy. Having a  large family was seen as a blessing by the average African man as this would  provide him with the labour force for his farm work. Consequently, many African  men opted for polygamy as a means of achieving this. But in the case of  Timothy’s father, he was not blessed with a large family and his only wife who  could have been his only helper on the farm was dead, he had no option but to  withdraw his only son from school in order to help him on the farm. So the old  Iyanda interrupted his son’s education while he was in Standard Three because  he wanted him to be his full-time helper on the farm.</p>

<p>Iyanda  worked with his father for some time on the farm and in his blacksmith’s  business, after which the young Iyanda returned to school and completed his  Standard Six education, a considerable level of education in those days.  He then went to Lagos, Nigeria, to become an  apprentice Motor Mechanic in 1954.  The  decision to move to Lagos did not receive the blessing of his father, because  the old man was of the opinion that his son would do better on the farm than  going to Lagos for his apprentice training. Iyanda, however, refused to give in  to his father’s persuasion as he was determined that acquiring a skill is a  better way of securing the future than staying on the farm.  In Lagos, Iyanda became the ward of David  Odubanjo of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC) fame, engaging in series of  menial tasks to keep body and soul together and to finance his motor mechanic  training.</p>

<p>After  his training in Lagos, he travelled to Ghana in 1957. Initially he was engaged  by a company as a motor mechanic, but later got involved in the diamond business.  Fortune smiled on him and three years later, Iyanda had become a wealthy businessman.  Though he could not be said to have had any  experience of salvation at this time while living with Pastor Odubanjo in  Lagos-Nigeria, he had encountered the Christian faith and notable ministers  such as the Apostle Joseph Ayodele Babalola also of the CAC and this had  developed in him a considerable level of commitment to the Christian faith.  Consequently, he built a church at Ghadamu, Ghana, which was later taken over  by the Baptist Church.</p>

<p><strong>Salvation Experience and Call to the  Ministry</strong></p>

<p>Iyanda  was born again in March 1963, when he read an overseas gospel tract.  According to him, “I read the tract and saw  the light and became disgusted with my sinful life. I experienced great sorrow  for my sin. Then the joy of God filled my heart.”  A great interest for the word of God and  evangelism developed in his heart and like the biblical Timothy, he became an  ardent evangelist distributing tracts and promoting the gospel message from  place to place. He became highly interested in the things of God, especially  soul-winning, prayer, and bible-reading.</p>

<p>He  received the baptism with the Holy Spirit at a prayer meeting. Thereafter his  life was characterized by some supernatural experiences which eventually  culminated in his call into the ministry. On a particular night, as he was  praying in the church at about 3 a.m. when he heard a voice like a thunder-clap.  His whole body trembled and the church building shook, just like the place  where the disciples were assembled after they had prayed in Acts 4:24-31 and  like the experience of John in Revelation 10:4, the message given to him by the  thunderous voice appeared to be more of a sealed message as Iyanda never  disclosed this to anyone for certain reasons.</p>

<p>The  following night, he had another experience which resembled that of the first.  He was expecting to hear another voice when he saw an angel trying to carry him  out of the church. Timothy then wondered why an angel of God should want to do  this to him. Through divine guidance, however, he noticed that this angel was  not an angel of God and a fight ensue between the two of them. He prevailed and  found his way back into the church. Thereafter it was explained to him by the  Holy Spirit that what he saw was for the future. He was warned to be on his  guard because in a time to come, the devil will want to draw him out of the  church through many side attractions, but he was to resist the devil so as to  prevail over him.  On another night, he  was in a revelation where a large number of angels appeared to him and oil was  poured on his head, anointing him for the ministry. That night he became  conscious of the call of God on his life. This anointing with oil was also  backed with an instruction to go and preach and to fulfill literally the  command in Matthew 19:21- “…go and sell that thou hast and give to the poor and  come and follow me”.  The Lord also drew  his attention to Matthew 10:38-39 - “…and anyone who does not take his cross  and follow me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it, and  whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.”</p>

<p>Consequently,  Iyanda lost interest in his business and became seized with the desire to go  places with the gospel.  He disposed of  all his possessions at rock-bottom prices and started giving the money to the  poor and beggars.  The Holy Spirit,  however, cautioned him that the poor in his context are the ministers of God.  These are those who had voluntarily chosen poverty on account of the gospel of Christ.  Coming to this understanding, he gave the rest of the money to ministers of  God.   His  decision was considered by many as sheer madness, considering the level of  poverty prevalent within his community at the time. Those were days when  traders and business people were the prime movers and the financial backbone of  the society and commanded a great deal of respect from all.  To find oneself in the position of a  “businessman” was considered a privilege which many would never attempt to  “throw away” as Iyanda had done. It was definitely a privilege no one would  want to lose for any consideration whatsoever.  His decision was therefore met with stiff  resistance by many people around him, including some ministers of God. His half  brother William Iyanda, who was living with him at the time, travelled home to  inform their father of what he considered the irrational behaviour of his elder  brother.  Iyanda, however, could not be  deterred. He understood what God expected of him in the circumstances in which  he found himself and was prepared to comply.</p>

<p><strong>Conflict with  Church Authorities</strong></p>

<p>In a night vision, Iyanda saw himself standing where D.  O. Babajide was ministering in Ilesa. Taking the vision literally, he left for  Ilesa and was with Babajide’s School of Prophets and Evangelists for three  months after which the Holy Spirit ordered him to go out for the work for which  he had been appointed. Initially, Iyanda’s ministry was based on two major  revelations he claimed to have received from God, which were limited to the  correction of ills in his church - the Christ Apostolic Church. Iyanda in his  first revelation saw a loaded train with passenger travelling on a rail line.  Part of this rail line was damaged and he knew this could spell disaster for  the train. Ironically, he saw the rail workers busy working but oblivious of  the damaged rail line.</p>

<p>Iyanda realized what needed to be done and was shown all  the equipment needed to repair the fault on the rail line. A voice warned him,  however, that his effort at this repair would not be appreciated and that he  might even be accused of causing the damage in the first place. Specifically,  the train he saw in the revelation was interpreted to be the Christ Apostolic  Church and the rail line on which it was travelling was the way of the gospel  on which the church is expected to travel. That the rail was faulty was an  indication that something was wrong with the way of the gospel on which the  church was moving. It was probably promoting a damaged (wrong) gospel, one  which is not likely to bring about the much expected change in the life of the  people. The pathetic part of it was that ministers of the church were not aware  of this anomaly. Irrespective of the danger this posed to the life of the  church then, Iyanda was warned that no matter how he might try, his effort to  correct the anomalies in the church would not be appreciated.</p>

<p>Despite the warning, Iyanda decided to do his best for  the Lord. He saw the church as God’s institution which must be rescued from  disaster. Consequently, his many sermons contained warnings for church leaders.  This never went down well with the leaders and as it happened to John Wesley in  his time when many bishops and clergy objected to him and his local preachers, Anglican  churches were often closed to them.[2] Iyanda ran into a similar conflict with  Church leaders. The doors of most of the churches were locked against him, his  ministerial credentials were ordered to be confiscated, and this order was  carried out during his visit to Okeigbo in Ondo State by the Christ Apostolic  Church (CAC). Without credentials from his church authority, no church was  prepared to accept and cooperate with him. It was a Cherubim and Seraphim  Church in Okeigbo that came to his rescue. The church allowed him to stay with  them in the town throughout the duration of the open-air evangelistic meetings which  he held there.</p>

<p>This resulted in great difficulty for the young Iyanda and  he cried unto God, “Lord those to whom you sent me have rejected me.” Then the  Lord replied, “Go to the streets and call all manner of people to the feast.”  Henceforth, he changed his mode of operation and started working independent of  the church. He went from one town to another, preaching the gospel of  the Lord Jesus Christ. Whenever he got to a town,  he would invite people from various churches  and religions to his open air revival meetings. His message then became a  message of salvation to all, urging them to repent of their sins and come into  the “Ark of Salvation,” Jesus Christ.</p>

<p><strong>His  Evangelistic Endeavours</strong></p>

<p>God instructed Iyanda to go to Oke-Iho, a town within  southwest Nigeria.  He sold some of his  remaining personal belongings, a ceremonial robe and a Bible, for which he got  two pounds and with an additional gift of one pound from a missionary, Parkyns,  whom he referred to as his spiritual father, he proceeded on the journey. At  Okeiho, the Lord began to demonstrate God’s mighty miracle-working power in Iyanda’s  ministry. His evangelistic and revival meetings became characterized by  astounding miracles of healing. The dumb  spoke, the deaf heard, and the blind had their sight restored in almost all of  his meetings. This gave him confidence and he breathed a sigh of relief  assuring himself that God was with him.</p>

<p>From  Oke-Iho, he moved to Iseyin, a town in the area, where he was compelled to  spend the night in the bush because no one was ready to accommodate him. The  church leaders refused to entertain him insisting that they could only do so if  they see his credentials from the head of his church. Leaving Iseyin, he went  to Shaki and notable conversion and miracles happened there. Prominent among  these was the case of a group of *Egungun *(masquerade)  adherents who deflected from the masquerade and started following Timothy  around until he got to the revival.</p>

<p>Traditional worship in Yorubaland of south-western Nigeria comprises  many different cults or guilds, prominent among which is the <em>Egungun *masquerade, considered the cult  of the ancestors. It is believed to have emanated from the belief of Africans  in resurrection after death. After the death of an aged person, an *Egungun</em> masquerade is made to  immortalize him. Consequently, the deceased is worshipped believing that he is  alive, though he has joined the ancestors. <em>Egungun</em> worship and its attendant festival is one of the prominent traditional celebration  that attract people of different classes for cultural, social, economical,  religious, and entertainment purposes.  It  has special time of celebration dedicated to it, which is the <em>Egungun *festival. It is believed that  during this festival deceased ancestors return to earth to visit and celebrate  with their living relations and thereafter bless them before returning to their  abode in heaven. Hence the *Egungun *are  usually referred to as “</em>Ara Orun-kinkin,  Baba mi*,” meaning “my father, the noble relative from heaven.”[3] It was  during one of these festivals that Iyanda entered Shaki and people were  surprised to witness the scenario discussed above. To many, this scenario is an  indication of the presence of the power of God with Iyanda.</p>

<p>The Egungun phenomenon poses serious threat to Christianity  in Yorubaland. It is one of the factors responsible for the slow pace of  Christianity in some areas and it is the main cause of syncretism in others. A  very popular lyric among the adherents of this cult during their festivals goes  thus in the Yoruba language:</p>

<p><em>A wa o s’oro ile wa ooo (2x)</em></p>

<p><em>Igbagbo o pe o eee, Igbagbo o pe k’awa ma  s’orooo</em></p>

<p><em>A wa o soro ile wa ooo</em></p>

<p>Meaning:</p>

<p>We  will celebrate our deity (2x)</p>

<p>Christianity  cannot debar us from this,</p>

<p>We  will celebrate our deity</p>

<p>Consequently, it is observed that many so called Christians  still participate in these festivals.   Though they are baptized and counted as members of the church, they  still have one leg in the church and another in traditional worship and this  amounts to syncretism.  Syncretism no  doubt poses a serious threat to the personal devotional life of the average  Christian.  It is in the light of this  that such ministries like that of Iyanda, which characterized the Christian  (Pentecostal) landscape in Yorubaland from the late 60s into the 70s, were  highly appreciated for the noble work God used them for in the conversion of  many traditional worshippers to Christianity.</p>

<p>Other miracles in Shaki included the healing of a dumb old  man and the restoration of sight to a blind man.  These miracles no doubt endeared Iyanda to  the people and a pastor of the Apostolic Church in the town. The pastor  consequently reported the development to prominent members of his church, who  sent a delegate from Ibadan to Iyanda in Shaki, persuading him to join their  church and work with them as a minister. Iyanda however rejected this offer,  explaining that getting stuck with a denomination will only restrict his  movement and defeat his objective of going into the nooks and crannies of the  world with the gospel of Christ. Once he was hooked to a church, he would only  be able to go wherever he was sent.</p>

<p>From Shaki, Iyanda conducted open-air revival meetings in  other cities of Yorubaland. He was in Oyo and Ogbomoso in 1964, and Lagos in  1965 after which he was at Ilorin, a Muslim dominated city, where Iyanda  secured a place in the centre of the city for his meeting. Incidentally, Ilorin  was a place where the preaching of the gospel was not allowed in certain areas  and the place of his first meeting was situated within one of these  “gospel-restricted” areas. Presentation of the gospel at Ilorin must be tactful  because of its predominantly Muslim population and Iyanda was quite aware of  that. He started his message in a highly persuasive manner, but at the mention  of the name of Jesus Christ, pebbles started flying towards him from all  directions and the meeting came to an abrupt end.   This  did not in any way deter Iyanda so he moved to Sabo to continue his revival  meeting. Sabo is another part of the city of Ilorin where there was a large  concentration of strangers and a place where one could do what was not  permitted in the Muslim dominated areas.  There was a mighty movement of God at Sabo as  many crippled walked. Among these was Karimu, a Muslim who had been crippled  for thirteen years and another was Muhammad Yaro who began to walk after eleven  years.  As a result of the miracle, many  of those who had disrupted the previous meeting started trooping to the  meetings. The people of Ilorin now became Iyanda’s friends and this gave him  the privilege of returning to conduct revival meetings in any part of the city undisturbed.</p>

<p>Iyanda also conducted open-air evangelistic meetings in other  notable cities across Nigeria. He was in Ibadan in 1967 and 1970.  Ibadan acclaimed to be the largest city in  West Africa is the present capital of Oyo State.   In 1970, he conducted five meetings across  the city and these were attended by signs and wonders. At one of these  meetings, one Ganiyu Lasisi who had been dumb for thirty-five years spoke  precisely on February 20, 1970. He was also at Abeokuta where a woman with an  “issue of water”, from whose body urine-like water flowed day and night, was healed.  Other places visited by Iyanda were Ijebu-Ode, Ijebu-Igbo, Lalupon Erunmu, and  Iwo all in southwest Nigeria; Zaria, Zamaru, Gusau, Kaduna, Kano in northern  Nigeria; Port Harcourt and Aba in eastern Nigeria.</p>

<p>Iyanda’s crusades were not confined to Nigeria. He travelled  to other parts of the world with the gospel of Christ. He was in Ghana,  Cameroon, Republic of Benin, Ivory Coast, Liberia Sierra Leone, Togo, and Kenya.  He also visited the United States of America, Amsterdam, England, Scotland, and  France. Everywhere he went God was with him and demonstrated His power in  enormous proportion.</p>

<p>Iyanda  was one of the first Christian ministers to appropriate the power of the media  in the propagation of the gospel.  He  made use of the radio, film and the television. He was on the network of many  radio and television stations. Prominent among these were Radio Nigeria Lagos,  Radio Enugu, Radio Lagos, Radio O-Y-O Ibadan, Ogun Radio Abeokuta, Radio Imo,  Owerri, Western Nigeria Television Service (WNTV) Ibadan, and the Nigerian  Television Authority, Lagos and Benin. Just as God performed miracles in his  revival meetings, so also He did through his Media Ministry. People were healed  of various forms of sicknesses through his ministrations over the airwaves. Whenever  Timothy Iyanda was preaching or praying on the Radio and TV, sick people would be  encouraged to have faith in God and lay their hands on their radio and TV sets  and would be healed of various diseases. Many testified to the series of  miracles of healings from sicknesses some of which had defied medical  solutions.  One Thomas from Ibadan  listened to Iyanda’s message on the radio and was saved. Later, he laid his  hand on the radio when Iyanda was praying and God healed him of eyes trouble.  The son of one Falade in Agege –Lagos, was unconscious. Iyanda came on the air  and began to preach. The troubled man placed one hand on his radio-set and the  other on the dying boy and God healed the child instantly. A woman Betty  Olaniyan living in France listened to a tape of Iyanda’s message and got a  miracle through it. God touched her barren womb as she was listening to the  tape message and she became pregnant.</p>

<p>Iyanda  was described as a tireless minister of the gospel and an ardent teacher of the  word of God. His eagerness to spread the Word of God was great. By the end of  the seventies, he had gone with the gospel and power of Jesus Christ to all  parts of Nigeria and to many African countries, such as, Cameroon, Republic of  Benin, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Togo and Kenya. Wherever he  went to hold evangelical/revival meetings, crowds gathered, multitude of people  were saved and healed of various sickness; many of which had defied the power  of medical science. He was a faithful and godly man, a good preacher and  teacher of God’s word, and one who loved the Lord.[4]</p>

<p>Iyanda  was married to Sarah Adunni Iyanda in 1964 and the marriage was blessed with  children.  On how they met, Sarah said,  "I was introduced to him by my uncle who recommended me to him. I remember  that my late husband came to Ile Ife for a revival and after the revival he  told my uncle who was also a reverend, that he needed a responsible wife. My  late uncle Afolabi told him that he had five girls with his own daughter but  could recommend me and could vouch for my character. I went to pray over it and  we eventually got married in 1964.”</p>

<p>Sarah Iyanda was a friend and a supporter of her  husband in the work of the minstry. She was always with him in all their  evangelistic trips and recounted some of her experiences during this period.  She recalled a particular incident in 1967  when her husband was arrested for spreading the gospel by throwing religious  leaflets from a helicopter in Lagos and Ibadan. Evangelist Iyanda in Lagos had hired  a helicopter for the distribution of flyers designed to invite people to one of  his crusades. The helicopter was throwing these flyers from the air and some of  it incidentally fell into Dodan barracks which was the then Nigeria’s seat of  power and residence of the then head of state General Yakubu Gowon. This was on  a day when the General was celebrating his birthday and members of his Supreme  Military Council and other state dignitaries were present.  Initially some thought it was money, but they  later discovered it was ordinary leaflets. However, such an incidence at the  seat of power at such a time was considered an embarrassment because it disrupted  the birthday ceremony.  At that time some  soldiers came to arrest the evangelist saying he had caused confusion and  commotion in the barracks. The incident was, however, investigated by the  police and they discovered that the evangelist meant no harm and the case was  dispelled.  Though a big blow to the  government, it made Iyanda popular.</p>

<p>The leaflets were picked up in certain quarter and  led to the salvation of some. A palm-wine tapper saw one of the leaflets on top  of the palm tree as he went up to tap palm wine. He brought it home and told  everybody that it was God that sent it to him. He could not imagine how he  could find a paper on top of the palm wine tree in a thick forest. He gave the  papers to people to read out for him and that was how he was converted to  Christianity.[5]</p>

<p>Sarah also recounted how God used her husband to  rescue a man who vomited stones in Cotonou in the Republic of Benin. According  to her, when they got to Cotonou the people were happy and they all trooped out  to see more miracles. The government seeing the multitude supported the team, drafted  some policemen to guard them, and even constructed a stage for use in the  revival service.  But it got to a point  when a man vomited stones and shouted thank you Jesus, a man dashed into the  crowd and shouted thank you Mary. This is because as Catholics, they believed  more in Mary the mother of Jesus than they did of Jesus. Iyanda ordered the man  to shut up and said he was shouting to Jesus and not to Mary. This mere mention  of Jesus’s name angered the crowd, the state police was invited, and the  Iyanda’s team was given 24 hours to leave their country. Thus, the crusade in  Cotonou ended abruptly and the team returned to Nigeria, but was never disheartened  as they felt the presence of God around them.</p>

<p>God used Iyanda for many other miracles of  healing.  According to his wife, a man  with a protruding stomach was brought to the crusade held in Ilesha. There was  another man with a mysterious illness which made him to drink twenty litres of  water three times a day. He was brought to the crusade ground from Ilesha by  six hefty men for prayers and he was cured of his mysterious illness.</p>

<p>Recalling the apostle’s last days as emotional, the  wife said, "He prayed for sometime and started praying in tongues at 3:00AM.  When I asked him what he was doing, he said he was praying for himself. He  blessed and served round a cup of water and then gave up the ghost. He was  really a man of God.”[6]</p>

<p>There  is need to give honour to whom it is due, however. It is impossible for a tree  to make a forest. In other words, Iyanda was not alone in the ministry, there  were others who were instrumental to the success story of GO YE Evangelistic  Ministry. Money or financial support occupies a pivotal position in the  promotion of the gospel. It is the reason why many ministries were not able to  make headway.  With reference to Iyanda,  he found a very diligent and committed financial supporter in Folorunso  Husswin, who was at the time one of the financial mainstays of the  ministry.  Husswin is an enterprising  Nigerian Church leader and businessman. He is the General Overseer of the Voice  of Redemption Gospel Church and the Proprietor of Gideon Children and Secondary  Schools, Isolo, Lagos, Nigeria. Husswin used his resources in the promotion of  the gospel and was a chief financier of many of the itinerant evangelists and  pastors in the country around the 60s through the 90s and into the year 2000.  Specifically with the GO YE Ministry, he was a very strong financial supporter  who stood by Iyanda during the period of his ministry. He supported him  financially and this made the ministry able to achieve tremendous success in  many of its endeavours. Husswin described Iyanda as a soldier of Christ who  answered the call of God and sincerely worked in God’s vineyard unless he left  the world.</p>

<p>Another  person worthy of note here is Aderinokun of Ibadan who assisted the evangelist  financially at a crucial time. According to Taiwo, in May 1974, Iyanda was to  conduct an open-air evangelistic meeting at Kaduna-Nigeria, but fell short of  funds in the middle of the arrangement. He was then led to Aderinokun in  Ibadan, who willingly gave all the money she had in her handbag. With this money  Iyanda was able to stage the Kaduna meeting, which was a huge success resulting  in the salvation, healing, and deliverance of many.[8]</p>

<p>Among  other supporters of Iyanda was Moses Olanrewaju, an itinerant evangelist and  President of the Jesus Witness Ministry in Lagos, Nigeria. He was with Iyanda  for many years assisting him in various aspects of the ministry. In Nigeria,  not all preachers preach in the English language, some do in their indigenous  tongue and consequently would need competent persons to translate their  messages into the English language. Olanrewaju is one of such competent hands  in the country, who assisted Iyanda in the translation of his messages into the  English language, at the open air evangelistic meetings, in the radio and the  television.  He performed this task and  other ministerial duties honestly and selflessly for many years.</p>

<p>The  next on the list of Iyanda’s supporter is Zaccheus O. Agbenike, known as  Brother Zaccheus and who is presently the General Overseer of Christ Beloved  Gospel Church, Lagos. He was one of Iyanda’s earliest converts and co-workers.  He and Samson were the principal staff of the ministry and he served  faithufully within the minstry for a very long time.</p>

<p>The  last but not least coworker and supporter of Iyanda was Samson who worked in  the office helping to dispatch letters to partners and also accompanied Iyanda  on some of his evangelistic tours across the nation. His contribution occurred at  a time when it was difficult to find a trusted and committed young man in  Nigeria for such a job was quite tremendous.</p>

<p>Recalling  his experience with Iyanda, Raphael Oye Taiwo decribed him as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"…a man who did what the early Christians did, in obedience to the Lord’s  order, ‘go ye therefore’. He was a man who, when the Lord called, ignored his  worldly wealth, took up his cross and followed his master without looking back in  doubt. A man who walked on a path of faith many with similar calling would have  quaked to walk on. A man who, in spite of the scoffs of the ungodly, the  jeering of the despisers of good people and the sting of hardship, fought  bravely on the battlefield of faith, refusing to give up."[9]</p>

  <p>"Listening to him in the evening of May 29, 2008 in his house, I  understood that this man was not through yet with the Lord’s battle… that the  devil had no cause to laugh as far as this man was concerned …. that his heart  was still set on the task nearest to the heart of the Lord, soul-winning … that  his heart was still burning with love for God like the heart was in the sixties  … that retirement from God’s work wasn’t on his priority list. He kept fighting  the Lord’s battle until his last days upon the earth. He would have loved to  keep fighting his Lord’s battle for another ten years. But his master had  another plan for him: to bring His faithful servant home to begin to enjoy the  joy of the Lord he loved and served so well."[10]</p>

  <p>"He died on the battlefield of faith with his boots on his feet and his  sword in his hands. I could imagine him saying, when he was about to leave the  world, ‘I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the  faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.’ (2nd  Timothy 4:7-8) I could almost hear the Lord saying to his servant, ‘Well-done,  thou faithful servant, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord!’ May God bless our  land with many more tough, brave, and dedicated soldiers of God like this man, Timothy  Aremu Iyanda, Founder and General Overseer, Go Ye Pentecostal Mission  International."[11]</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Iyanda  was a man loved and respected by his people. His divine ability was appreciated  by his followers and his life is an inspiration to members of his ministry, GO  YE Pentecostal Mission International.  In  August of 2009, Timothy Aremu Iyanda went home to be with the Lord at the age of  74.</p>
