<p><strong>Childhood</strong></p>

<p>Émilienne was born in  Congo-Brazzaville, on December 24, 1957, in the small town of Kimongo, in the Niari region. Daughter of Loubota  Mbinda Albert, deacon in the annex of Kimouélé in the consistory of  Louila-Kimongo [1], and Dienze Tsimba Esther, parishioner of the same annex,  Émilienne was raised in a God-fearing family. Eldest in a family of eight  children, she was full of love for her siblings and wished them to succeed in  life. Her younger brother, Misère Emmanuel Loubota, remembers her as follows:</p>

<p>She was an older sister of good character; she was  kind. She was especially very cheerful and loved to have her little brothers at her side.  She played the role of a mother toward her siblings. [2]</p>

<p>Émilienne attended Emery Patrice Lumumba elementary school from 1965 to  1972, in Kimongo. She began her middle school at Sollat Hilaire in the same  town. Disciplined and diligent, Émilienne had excellent grades. But her  brilliant scholastic progress came to an abrupt end when she decided to abandon  her studies in 1974, while she was in seventh grade. This decision was not  undertaken lightly; in fact it shows Émilienne’s maturity at the age of 15.  Émilienne was frequently "courted by teachers" and she decided to  leave in order to avoid "falling into temptation.” [3]</p>

<p>Deplorably, the sexual harassment of minors by some teachers caused many of  them to drop out of school, to contract venereal diseases, or to end up with  unwanted pregnancies and a future life of sexual promiscuity.</p>

<p>Instead of compromising her integrity, Émilienne chose to drop out of  school and walk in the fear of God. She undertook the only decision that was within her reach in order to express her  protest against a practice that debased and continues to degrade innocent young  girls. She has thus left us an eloquent example of obedience to the Lord.</p>

<p><strong>Calling</strong></p>

<p>Émilienne was actively involved in the different programs of her annex and  parish. Baptized in 1972, she was already at that time the leader of the local  choir.</p>

<p>After abandoning her studies, Émilienne devoted herself to God’s work.  She felt a burning desire to serve the Lord.  During that period she taught catechism and was mentored by the evangelist John  Paul Makosso. Having seen her dedication to the Lord and having perceived her  call, he commended her to pastor Roger Bavibidila, president of the consistory  and head of five parishes.</p>

<p>In 1974, Émilienne was appointed consistorial secretary in Diambala [4] under  the leadership of pastor Bavibidila. This position helped her assert the desire  to serve God full-time, even though no woman in the EEC had become a pastor  since the synodal Council had voted that women could become pastors in the  Church. [5]</p>

<p>Émilienne was not the first Congolese woman who wished to serve the Lord as  a pastor. Indeed, since 1969, when the EEC allowed women in pastoral ministry,  there had been unfortunate candidates who did not even get the opportunity to  take the pastoral test. In the parish of Mbanza Tsibi, for example, annex Kampala, there was a  woman who had applied to become pastor. Unfortunately, she was denied that  possibility and was not even allowed to become an evangelist. [6] Adversity  against the pastoral ministry of women was like a wall in their way.</p>

<p>As a woman, becoming a pastor was an important step for young Émilienne,  and the path was not without drawbacks. Difficulties began with her own family,  as her brother Misère Loubota explains, “At the beginning of her calling, our  parents believed that it was an adventurous thing to have a woman practice pastoral  ministry.” [7] It must have been a shock to her parents to know that their daughter  wanted to venture into territory that was new and probably uncertain in their  eyes.</p>

<p>Even though her premature abandonment of her studies weakened her, she  thought about taking the pastoral exam. Determined, Émilienne confided in her pastor  about her sense of being called to full time ministry. After that, pastor  Bavibidila recommended her and two others, Elie Ndagami and Ndala Joel, to the  synodal Council as pastoral candidates.</p>

<p>By encouraging her to follow God’s call, Pastor Bavibidila displayed a  spirit of humility and wisdom before God. He recognized that this young woman  had the necessary talents and character to serve her God full time, and he  decided to encourage and mentor her.</p>

<p>In 1976, the three candidates took the test for theological training at the  Seminary of Mantsimou in Brazzaville.  Émilienne was the only one to pass it. [8] It was a big step towards the  fulfillment of her goal. On October 1, 1976, the young Émilienne Niangui  Loubota, age 19, started her classes at the Seminary of Mantsimou, the only  woman among the men.</p>

<p><strong>Pastoral  Training</strong></p>

<p>Émilienne’s arrival at the seminary was a turning point in her life and in  the life of the EEC. Pastoral training has two components: academic formation  and practical training.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Training</strong></p>

<p>Émilienne started with the pre-pastoral cycle reserved for students who do  not have a middle school certificate. [9] She worked hard, both in her classes  and [to obtain] the national middle school certificate. After her success, she  started her pastoral training, which lasted five years. However, her adjustment  was not easy. It was very daunting to find herself the only woman among all these  young men as she admitted in an interview with Raymond Bitemo, [10] “The  beginnings were difficult. At times I  felt deficient.” [11]</p>

<p>In this male environment, she had to overcome the difficulties of  adaptation. After a few weeks, Émilienne began to feel comfortable with her  teachers and classmates. She stated in the same interview, “Very quickly, I  grew accustomed to my colleagues that I now considered like my brothers, and I  was their sister.” [12]</p>

<p>Émilienne was a young woman with very pronounced personal principles. For  example, upon her arrival to the seminary, she refused to integrate [13] into  the pastors’ wives group saying, "What will I learn from them?”  [14] Far from being proud, Émilienne expressed a fundamental need to spend time  with classmates. She felt accepted and enjoyed sharing and studying with them.</p>

<p>As months went by, Émilienne  felt relaxed among her colleagues, flourished in her personality and found her  place. Pastor Tsibatala, one of her colleagues at the time, said, "She was  a man among men; no one could dominate her.” [15]</p>

<p>Émilienne was not  afraid to give her opinion; she displayed exceptional bravery and honesty. Pastor  Moundanga remembered her in these terms: "When there were  misunderstandings or small conflicts between us, she was neither afraid nor  ashamed to denounce the one that was wrong.” [16] Pastor Loussakou has added,  "She was not afraid to speak up; when things were not going well, she voiced  herself openly and frankly.” [17]</p>

<p>Even as she was smiling  and welcoming, Émilienne was very serious in her calling and studies. On the  academic front, she was coping very well. Her classmates recognized that she  was intelligent and was always among the six best.</p>

<p>During this period, the  presence of a woman among student-pastors came as a shock to some people. When  the illustrious evangelist pastor Ndoundou Daniel first saw Émilienne Niangui  Loubota among the student-pastors, he was very upset. He called three of them:  Bamana, Yindoula, and Kibalou, to inquire into the reason why this young woman  was in the seminary. They explained to him that she was being trained as a pastor  too. Having realized this, pastor Ndoundou advised them to mentor her well.  [18] Professors, missionaries and classmates helped young Émilienne to thrive  academically.</p>

<p><strong>Preaching Practicum</strong></p>

<p>Émilienne, like all the  other pastors in training, had to spend two months of each year doing a  practicum, during the dry season, in two different parishes. She spent her time  in the parishes of Kimouélé and Kitsindi. The evangelists [19] and her brother,  who sometimes accompanied and mentored her, played a considerable role in her  spiritual growth.</p>

<p>She was perceived as a  tireless servant of the Lord. Mrs. Jeanne Balehola, who was a young girl in the  Kindounga annex (of the Kitsindi parish), remembered that period well,  because  Émilienne shared her room, due  to lack of other accommodations.  This is  how she describes Émilienne’s  ministry:</p>

<p>When  she came to our parish with many annexes, she spent three days in an annex, and  was accompanied by an evangelist on these tours; she preached and sometimes led  the morning worship (6:00 to 7:00 am) as well as the evening worship (8:00 to  10:00 pm). [20]</p>

<p>Émilienne was  "eloquent in her preaching; she had the art of communicating the Word of  God.” [21] During her internship, Émilienne would take time to communicate with  women of all ages. Often she would say "I came for you mothers and girls.  Come forward at the end of the service so that we may pray.” [22] She spoke  tirelessly, encouraged, and prayed with women. She was “nice, open, cheerful and friendly.”  [23] Émilienne did not put herself on a pedestal, but participated in the  activities with the parishioners.</p>

<p>On the two Wednesdays  of the first half of October, student-pastors talked about their activities  during the practicum, in addition to the report that the consistory sent to the  seminar. Émilienne, who worked as hard as the others, did not find it difficult  to speak of her activities during the internship.</p>

<p>To be among the  forerunners was a difficult task, as challenges and obstacles to her ministry  abounded. She acknowledged this in her interview with Raymond Bitemo.</p>

<p>But  I must point out that the learning of any job is difficult. Problems abound. In  my case, I have sometimes known difficult moments in my training. But with the  help of God, the advice and encouragement of pastors Nkounkou and Buana, I was  able to surmount all obstacles. [24]</p>

<p>As a servant of the Lord  Jesus Christ, she also experienced 2 Timothy 3: 12, which says, "In fact,  everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be  persecuted."</p>

<p>The scars left by  moments of misunderstanding, humiliation, and attacks on her person and  ministry were so deep that her pain and suffering can be felt through the  remarks reported in the preface to the thesis that she defended at the end of her  seminary years:</p>

<p>Since  I started here, I recognize that in this seminary I have been sometimes  ridiculed, unfairly attacked, wrongly criticized by certain persons. [25]</p>

<p>Despite these  persecutions, Émilienne ran her race. In June of 1985 she received her pastoral  degree and she was ready for divine service. Those nine years of pastoral  training at Mantsimou were a great achievement and a first, as she put it:  “Being a pastor was for me a goal. I reached it and I feel a deep sense of  joy.” [26]</p>

<p>At the end of her pastoral  training, the whole church was thankful to God for her heroism and endurance.  Joseph Mandzoungou described her graduation as “The EVENT in the history of the  EEC,” because it was the first time since the start of the Swedish missionary  work that gave birth to the Evangelical Church of Congo that a woman was among  the pastors. [27] And Raymond Bitemo spoke of the first “female product” of the  EEC.</p>

<p>Émilienne’s graduation  did not go unnoticed in the country. The national newspaper <em>Mweti</em> published an article that began by  announcing that among “the 27 students graduating this year from the  Theological Seminary of Mantsimou, a place of honor is bestowed to Mrs.  Mboungou-Mouyabi, born Niangui Loubota Émilienne.” [28]</p>

<p>Her colleagues were pleased with her prowess. Pastor  Jean Baptiste Milongo said that she was “the pride of our class.” The Reverend  Dr. Dominique Tsibatala spoke of “a blessed class.” Her family and her church  were proud of her. The EEC started to make plans to send her to Sweden to  continue her studies. Émilienne was honored that day and hailed as a symbol of winds  of change [that were] blowing in the EEC. She herself envisioned her imminent  ministry as a sign of openness to women in pastoral ministry and as a movement  of progress within the EEC:</p>

<p>The joy of being the  first woman pastor translates in me as a sign of our church growth and  Christian women’s awareness to work more with the men for the advancement of  the work of the Lord. That is why I invite all women, including girls who feel  the calling to become pastors, to not back down, but pray and go forward with  faith. [29]</p>

<p><strong>Marriage</strong></p>

<p>Towards the end of her studies, Émilienne was  troubled by the question of marriage. She feared God, walking in the purity of  heart and body, seeking his will. Émilienne did not want to marry a layman for fear  that he would prevent her from freely exercising her pastoral ministry. [30]</p>

<p>At that time, three of the student-pastors were  single: two male students and her. Émilienne received a marriage proposal from  one of the student-pastors, but because of opposition in the family and  probably other factors, she declined the offer.</p>

<p>In 1982, Rev. Dr. Pierre Mboungou Mouyabi returned  from France. As a PhD student in Paris, Pierre was abandoned by his wife, who  found him to be too poor. [31] He arrived in the Congo as a bruised and  divorced father. He was appointed at the Mantsimou Seminary to teach New  Testament. It was in this seminary and in the context of his work that he first  saw Émilienne Niangui-Loubota, who was one of his students. A few months later,  he proposed marriage to her. Encouraged and advised by pastor Madiata and his  wife, she accepted his proposal.</p>

<p>Émilienne was a very bright student and her  professors saw a future both for her and for the EEC in the pursuit of her  studies. Therefore, her marriage to Dr. Mboungou-Mouyabi disappointed some  leaders of the Church and probably some missionaries too. Some of them even  verbalized their disapproval, since Mboungou Mouyabi had conflicting  relationships with a few of his colleagues and leaders in the Church.</p>

<p>But this did not prevent the couple from celebrating  their traditional marriage in 1982, in Kimouelé. Then, on January 30, 1984,  their civil marriage ceremony was carried out by the President of the Court,  Dimynat Diangala, in Dolisie. Thus, they became the first pastoral couple of  the EEC. Émilienne was pleased to have married a servant of God, someone who  had the same vision for lost souls and for the work of God. She confided to Raymond  Bitemo in an interview: "My joy is complete to have a husband who is a pastor  and shares the same aspirations as me. This greatly comforts me.” [32]</p>

<p>As a wife and mother, Émilienne was a benevolent  woman and a vigorous worker. She cared for her husband’s children, having  taught them what she had received. Her step-daughter Viviane Kombo remembered  her with the following words: "We have lived five solid years, rich in  daily emotions. She was a mother, and the day of her death, it was a tragedy.”  [33] Pastor Ruth-Annie Mampembe-Coyault, her other stepdaughter, speaks of “a woman  rather low-key, very hard working with her hands: in Mouyondzi, she planted her  own vegetable gardens, in addition to her pastoral ministry.” [34] Recalling  their life together, widower Mboungou-Mouyabi spoke with nostalgia of  "five years of peace and pastoral joy.” [35]</p>

<p>At the end of her studies, Émilienne and her husband  were sent to the consistory of Kolo and began their ministry.</p>

<p><strong>Ministry</strong></p>

<p>The minutes of the synodal council of the EEC in  Brazzaville, dated July 3 to 5, 1985, state that Pierre Mboungou-Mouyabi and  his wife were sent to the consistory of Kolo. At that time some leaders of the  Church did not want a pastoral couple to serve in the same parish. Mr. and Mrs.  Mboungou-Mouyabi were therefore assigned to different parishes. He had the  responsibility of two parishes: Mouyondzi and Kinguala, in addition to the  youth of the consistory, while his wife was responsible for the parish of  Mouzanga.</p>

<p>Émilienne was ready to put into practice the words  of wisdom she had uttered a few months earlier in an interview with Raymond  Bitemo:</p>

<p>To lead a parish, is to  lead men. It is a difficult task, but what is important is that the work is  organized and responsibilities well-defined. The pastor is always helped in his  task by advisors, deacons, deaconesses and believers themselves who are his  allies.” [36]</p>

<p>Émilienne left her husband and her step-daughters  and went to the parish that had been assigned to her. She was warmly welcomed  by her parishioners and served her Lord wholeheartedly. However, Mouzanga was a  highly malaria-contaminated and fairly primitive area. Access to drinking water  and food required considerable efforts. Life in Mouzanga was a real challenge  for her. Viviane, who visited this parish with her step-mother, recalled:</p>

<p>She was sent in a  remote village of Mouyondzi. She left her home and went to this village to  serve the Lord. She came back every two weeks or so. It was really a challenge  for her as a woman. The living conditions in the village were very rudimentary.  I remember. I went there once with her. But parishioners made sure she had  water and food; things that were difficult to have. She had a very good contact  with the Christians in this village. [37]</p>

<p>Émilienne knew whom she had put her faith in, and it  was with joy that she proclaimed the Gospel of Jesus Christ in those  circumstances. She was very open in her sermons. With her soft and captivating  voice, she shared with the congregation what God put in her heart, trying to  help them understand the mysteries of God’s Word. Sometimes, at the end of her  sermons, she would allow her listeners to ask questions, which she was always  quick to answer. [38]</p>

<p>Courageous and determined, she treated her  parishioners and those who came in contact with her with compassion. Émilienne  abhorred lies and was known for her truthful behavior. People were attracted by  her charisma and personality. She was a convener of the masses. Émilienne  carried out her ministry with dedication, efficiency, and good will, even  though separation from her family for part of the month was a considerable  sacrifice. Émilienne was “a reasonable woman and [an] outstanding woman.” [39]</p>

<p>After she had served in Mouzanga for some time, Émilienne  struggled with malaria, like the rest of the people. The regional physician, “a  little panicked” [40] because of the resurgence of crises of malaria in the  area, suggested to the EEC that it was a bit risky for a young mother to live  in these conditions. After some consideration, the church sent Émilienne to  Mouyondzi, where she served with her husband. However, the good times spent in  Mouzanga were not forgotten. Women could serve God as pastors just like men.  "The myth is broken.” [41]</p>

<p>Work in Mouyondzi took a different form as Émilienne  was now sharing the responsibilities of the parish with her husband. The pastoral  life still was not easy, especially on financial grounds. With a monthly salary  of 28,000 francs (about $61) and 55,000 francs ($120) for her husband, Émilienne  resorted to planting peanut and cassava gardens to supplement the needs of her  family. During two years of service in the consistory of Kolo, Émilienne showed  a passion for feeding God’s people spiritually. She was often going and  speaking where the Church needed her services.</p>

<p>As the first woman pastor, Émilienne’s work was not  confined to her parish. In 1987, after working for two years in the consistory  of Kolo, she was removed from her parish to facilitate her appointment to the  EEC’s department for work among women, whose headquarters were in Brazzaville.  That department, chaired at that time by Mrs. Sikou Philomène, aimed for the  well-being of women. Or, as stated by David Mboungou, its aims were "the  struggle for the rights and duties of women.” [42] This appointment caused some  tension in Émilienne’s family and marriage because she often traveled between  Mouyondzi and Brazzaville to fulfill the many requirements linked to her new  position. Mrs. Loubamba remembers those times as follows:</p>

<p>We often met and had a  close relationship. I was a member of the national organization L’Œuvre  Féminine. She worked there. She always had a vision. She travelled with Mama  Sikou Philomène. [43]</p>

<p>In March of 1987, Émilienne was ordained as a pastor  in the EEC, along with the rest of her class. Her ordination was a memorable  day for the women of the EEC and a great historic event for the Church in the  sense of change. Mrs. Loubamba stated: "the women were honored and happy  and they gave donations. We cried with joy when she was ordained.” [44] It was not only the women of the EEC who saluted  the first female pastor, but the whole Church celebrated its “first female  product.”</p>

<p>It is important to mention that  Émilienne’s ministry was profoundly influenced by her prayer life. She drew her  strength and inspiration from God. Her parents in Kimouélé recognized this  dimension of her life:</p>

<p>It is through prayer  that she managed to become a pastor. [When she] was getting ready for the exam,  in all the letters she sent to the parents, she did not forget to ask them to  pray a lot. <em>It’s through prayer that she  succeeded</em>. She liked prayer. She sometimes prayed alone or in a group. [45]</p>

<p>Monique Loubassou said she was a woman of prayer,  and evangelist François Mvoumbi-Poungui affirmed that “she had spiritual gifts  and loved prayer."</p>

<p><strong>Her  death</strong></p>

<p>In 1988, the church leaders decided that the best  five students from the class of 1985 would take the entrance exam for the  Protestant Theological Faculty of Yaoundé in Cameroon. As part of the group, Émilienne  traveled to Brazzaville in January of 1989 to prepare for and to take the exam.  At that time, she was pregnant with her second child.</p>

<p>Shortly after her arrival at the seminary, she  suffered from malaria and was treated by a Swedish nurse. As her health did not  improve, her husband came hastily to Brazzaville to be with her. She was taken  to Makélé-kélé hospital where medical examinations showed that she was  suffering from anemia and high blood pressure. In addition, her pregnancy  threatened to end in a miscarriage. She was therefore hospitalized on February  21, 1989.</p>

<p>On May 10, she gave birth by C-section. But after  the birth of her daughter, her blood pressure remained dangerously high.  Fifteen days later, on May 25 at 4: 30 pm, Émilienne Mboungou-Mouyabi, at age  thirty-two, entered into glory to be with the Lord.</p>

<p>Her death was received as a shock that paralyzed  members of the EEC. Raymond Bitemo captured the atmosphere of the moment:</p>

<p>The news of her death  spread the same evening in the capital as a wave whose brutal shock unnerved  Christians and especially women, who were almost all in tears. [46]</p>

<p>Her death left a huge feeling of emptiness in the  consistory of Louila-Kimongo, and people grieve her premature departure to this  day. [47] Members of her graduating class and her family were deeply affected. Pastor  Jean Baptiste Milongo said "I heard about her death in the train between  Mindouli and Missafou. [When] they announced this to me, I almost fell. I went  to Brazzaville.” [48] Pastor Tsibatala said, "She has left a void for our  class; it was a shock. Until today this regret is there. She was the first to  leave us; very young she left us.” [49]</p>

<p>Mrs. Loubamba agreed: "She left us one evening;  her sudden departure perturbed me.” [50] Her mother (who took care of the  orphaned baby), traumatized by her daughter’s premature death and overwhelmed  by grief, spent five years in mourning and did not want any of her remaining  children to become pastors. As for Émilienne’s husband, he never fully  recovered from losing her, and it was clear during an interview with the author  that his pain was still present.</p>

<p>The mortuary vigil held in Brazzaville, in the  parish of Bacongo, was filled with members of the EEC, the Catholic Church, the  Salvation Army, and the Kimbanguist church. At this vigil, the desperate prayer  of a Christian woman expressed the state of mind and the thoughts of many:</p>

<p>Lord, in our churches  we have many men pastors and we only had this one as a woman pastor. Why did  you not choose to take a pastor from among the men and let the only and first  woman pastor live? God,  you’re  unfair. [51]</p>

<p>Five days later, accompanied by a procession of  hundreds of people, Émilienne’s body was taken to Dolisie by train, then on to  Kimouélé by truck. It was with dismay, pain, and prayer that she was buried in  the family cemetery.</p>

<p>Her premature death was seen as a tragedy. Some  women in the consistory of Louila-Kimongo who wanted to serve God as pastors  renounced their calling for fear that they would eventually meet the same fate.  Evangelist Mvoumbi summarized their feelings in these words: "In the  consistory people have callings, but unanswered callings. Women, especially,  when they think of [her death], abandon the calling.” [52]</p>

<p>In the eyes of those who loved her, Émilienne should  not have died; she still had work to do. She left an emptiness which could not  be filled. However, Émilienne went to be with her God and heard these words:  "Enter in [to] your rest, good and faithful servant."</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Émilienne Niangui Loubota lived a short life, but  she left a considerable and positive impact that is still significant today.  She had a burden and a vision for the women of the EEC that became a recurring  theme in her talks, "Kilokola ya bakento me kulunga" (The hour of  women is here): "We need to serve the Lord; not only me, but all women  after me.” [53]</p>

<p>Her ambition and prayer was to see the Lord touch  Congolese society through a cohort of women pastors. Thus, she continuously  encouraged young women to serve the Lord in the Church. And her message was  joyfully received by the women of the EEC, who were delighted to finally have a  woman pastor.</p>

<p>Her footprint in the EEC is huge and indelible. As Pastor Alphonse Loussakou said, "She broke  the myth of not receiving women in the pastoral ministry.” [54] Dr.  Tsibatala exclaimed: “her testimony was to be understood [like this:] that we  do not recognize a pastor by his cloak,” [55] (appearances can be deceiving).  Her example has helped many sisters take the decisive step toward their pastoral  ministry. Monique Loubassou, who became the second woman pastor in the EEC, is  one example, and here is her testimony:</p>

<p>In  1985, when they graduated from seminary, our Mayangui choir came to sing at the  closing service of the academic year of the Seminary of Mantsimou. When I saw  her, I thought to myself, as the pastoral calling has been burning in me for  years, why can I not be like this woman pastor? Since she has dared, I can also  do it. [56]</p>

<p>The vision that God  opened before Émilienne, one of women serving the Lord in pastoral ministry,  was impressive and ambitious. She demonstrated it through her life, and others  have done the same. Pastor Ruth-Annie Mampembe-Coyault says in the same spirit,  "I think that her example has left a big impression on the women of the  EEC and has allowed them to understand that it is possible for them to serve  God as pastors.” [57]</p>

<p>At this point we want  to note that Émilienne was not the first woman to attend seminary. The first  woman, whose name need not be mentioned here, was approved when the seminary  was still in Ngouedi, but she was not able to continue her training because of  sin in her life, and she was sent away. [58] Émilienne did not shame her Lord.  She disgraced neither her family nor her church. She left the exemplary  testimony of a woman dedicated to her Lord, someone whose deepest desire was to  serve him wholeheartedly. She opened the way for other women pastors. Pastor  Laurent Loubassou said, "As she had not betrayed her calling, her main  contribution, in my opinion, has been an incentive for the EEC to continue to  accept women to full time pastoral ministry.” [59] Pastor Tsibatala has  concurred, saying, "It is thanks to her that today we have other women pastors.”  [60] Today the Evangelical Church of the Congo has fifteen women-pastors and  evangelists.</p>

<p>Émilienne  Niangui-Loubota is a symbol of the emancipation of women in the EEC and the  fight against rampant sexism. Through her, the Lord has shown that He can use  women as well as men in His service. Her admission into pastoral ministry  brought about a new atmosphere in the EEC. She was up to the task that was  entrusted to her. Her courage, enthusiasm, and determination opened the door to  divine service for other women. To our eyes her death was premature, but God  accomplished His purpose in her short life. May our hearts not forget this  exceptional woman, a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ. [61]</p>

<p><strong>Author’s Note</strong>: The desire to write the biography of the first woman pastor  of the Evangelical Church of Congo (EEC) originated while I was working on the  article on Pastor Jean Mboungou. As I read through the booklet <em>Biography [sic] of the Pastors of the Evangelical Church of the Congo</em>, published  in 2009, I noticed that Pastor Émilienne Mboungou-Mouyabi (<em>née</em> Niangui Loubota) was not included. This led me to ask the  following questions: Why was she not included? Who was she? What has she done?</p>

<p>Pastor Monique Loubassou experienced similar difficulties when she was  doing research for her thesis: “I defended my thesis at the end of my seminary years  on the topic of the women’s organization Œuvre Féminine. And nobody supplied me  with more information about her [Émilienne Niangui Loubota] and her work.”  (Monique Loubassou, interview by author, November 22, 2010, Brazzaville)</p>

<p>Pastor Jean  Baptiste Milongo noted that "the whole Church does not have enough  recollection of this woman.” (Jean Baptiste Milongo, interview by author,  January 20, 2011, Brazzaville)</p>

<p>The role of the first woman pastor  of the EEC is too important to be forgotten and relegated to the past. That is  why Pastor Eliser Moussounga of the EEC and I decided to write this article. We  want to express our sincere appreciation to all those who kindly responded to  our survey and have thus enabled us to revisit the life of this remarkable  woman.</p>

<p>The admission of women to the pastoral ministry  represents a turning point in the Church, and the Evangelical Church of Congo  is no exception. For these women pioneers, who faced the socio-cultural  pressures of their country and other religious obstacles, it was a very complex  period of time in their life and in their ministry. Acclaimed in <em>Mweti</em> (the most popular national  newspaper in the Congo in the 1980s), the first woman pastor is mentioned on  the first page of issue 1193, dated Friday July 5, 1985, as  "woman-Pastor." Also, she was featured on the cover of <em>Le Chemin</em>, the EEC newspaper (issue 12,  July-September 1985) with the phrase “Finally a woman pastor.” Émilienne  Niangui Loubota has become an emblematic figure of the EEC, a pioneer in the  field of pastoral ministry.</p>
