<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Many people have contributed to the growth and development of Christianity in Africa. Some have worked tirelessly singlehandedly, while others have worked tirelessly alongside Western missionaries, planting, growing, developing, administering, and leading the church in various ways. Recently, with the establishment of the African dictionary of Christianity as Boston University in the United States of America, a number of silent heroes who did a lot of good work for the Kingdom of God are being recognized, with elements of their lives and Christian work put in writing for future knowledge and use.</p>

<p>This article aims at delving into the person, work, and ministry of one Christian named Rev. John Zulu, who was for over thirty years a minister in the Church of the Nazarene in Zambia. Zulu served as a pastor, church administrator, and a leader for Church of the Nazarene’s Zambia South District and the Copperbelt District. This article therefore is written to honor a man whose life of service extended far beyond the pulpit. John Zulu was not just a preacher but also a spiritual mentor, evangelist, church planter, administrator, and a leader. Indeed, his influence can still be felt in the congregations he nurtured, in the lives of the leaders he trained, and the lives he touched.</p>

<p>Further, I aim to preserve the memory of one of the true servants of God and to inspire others who may not have had the chance to know him. As you journey through this article, you will discover the man behind the ministry, his admirable faith, and the enduring legacy he left for the Church of the Nazarene in Zambia which extended beyond Zambia’s borders. He served the Church of the Nazarene for about 30 years till his untimely demise in 2005 in the Copperbelt while serving as the District Superintendent.</p>

<p>We now turn to his life and ministerial service through the Church of the Nazarene.[1]</p>

<h3 id="early-life-conversion-and-call-into-ministry-in-the-church-of-the-nazarene">Early Life, Conversion, and Call into Ministry in the Church of the Nazarene</h3>

<p>John Zulu could be described as a catalyst; a man of faith, a person of integrity and dedication to the things of the church; and possessing a leadership style that characterized a vision specifically for the Church of the Nazarene [2] in Zambia, but also more broadly for the church and Christianity in general.</p>

<p>John Zulu was born in 1950 in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, and came to Zambia with his parents when he was 13 years old and settled in the Eastern Province of Zambia. He grew up in this part of Zambia before moving to Lusaka in search for employment in the early 1970s. In Lusaka, Zulu met some missionaries who introduced him to the Church of the Nazarene. [3]</p>

<p>Zulu’s father was Zambian, but his mother was a Zimbabwean. Prior to becoming a member of the Church of the Nazarene and heeding the call to active Christian ministry, Zulu was a member of the Catholic Church, in which his parents raised him in those initial years of his life. Although little is documented about his childhood, it is evident that his upbringing influenced his later commitment to the Church of the Nazarene. His mother consistently said, “If Mary, the mother of Jesus, is to go to heaven on account of her Son Jesus, I will also go to heaven on account of my son, John, who is so humble and morally upright. He shuns antagonism with anyone.”[4]</p>

<p>John Zulu was introduced to the Church of the Nazarene by a friend named Domingo Banda who was an employee at Nazarene Missionary Church Compound — Woodlands Church of the Nazarene — which later expanded and included the Nazarene Theological College (NTC), in Lusaka, Zambia. Banda introduced Zulu to the Nazarene missionary, Rev. John Hughes. It was this missionary who played a key role in encouraging Zulu to heed his call into ministerial service in the Church of the Nazarene.[5] This was a journey marked by a deep commitment to serving both God and the people around him.</p>

<p>Subsequent to his interactions with Rev. Hughes, Zulu found the Lord at the age of 21, just as soon as he got into Lusaka, and he soon after embraced a call to ministry that would leave an indelible impact on the church, his community, and his family, to whom he was also a pastor. He consistently taught his six children the power of forgiveness, emphasizing we are to quickly forgive those who wrong us, just as God forgives our wrong doings.</p>

<p>In 1972 while in Lusaka and in close contact with the Nazarene missionaries, John Zulu married Rosemary Mumba. Their wedding was officiated and blessed by Rev. John Hughes at Woodlands Church of the Nazarene. And soon after their wedding, John and Rosemary went to the Nazarene Bible College in Blantyre, Malawi.[6] The Bible College in Malawi welcomed students from Malawi, Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique. While at the college in Malawi, John Zulu and Rosemary had their first two children — Sophia and Elina, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="theological-training-in-malawi-zulus-ministry-leadership-and-church-administration-in-zambia">Theological Training in Malawi: Zulu’s Ministry, Leadership, and Church Administration in Zambia</h3>

<p>John Zulu was called into God’s kingdom through the Church of the Nazarene. And it is within the confines of this church that he exhibited his servanthood lifestyle which went beyond that denomination, touching Zambia’s wider Christian society. Prior to Zulu’s time at Bible school, he was a Sunday school teacher and a lay preacher for one or two years. This came about when Missionary Hughes saw some giftedness, talents, and commitment in Zulu and consequently assigned him lay ministerial service in Chilenje Church of the Nazarene, located in the Zambia South District in Lusaka.</p>

<p>Apparently, it was this assignment that internalized John Zulu’s call into pastoral ministry. This moment in that year marked a significant change in his life and set him on a path toward ministry. John Zulu felt a calling to serve as a pastor, prompting him to enroll in Nazarene Bible College in Blantyre, Malawi, in 1973. He graduated in 1976 and was ordained in 1978. Having been ordained [7], Zulu became an Elder in the Church of the Nazarene, a rank or position that accorded him privileges of being appointed or elected to various leadership roles within the Church of the Nazarene. For one thing, ordination connotes one’s responsibilities to “put to order” the general and specific ministries of the Church of the Nazarene. And with such responsibilities, John Zulu found himself on the pedestal for church leadership and administration roles.</p>

<p>Indeed, following his ordination in 1978, Zulu began his ministry with a deep passion for spreading the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. His first assignment as a pastor at Chilenje Church laid a foundation for his impactful service in the ensuing years of his pastoral work.</p>

<p>During the ten years following his graduation from the Nazarene Bible College,  Zulu expanded his ministry by opening and pastoring multiple churches, including the Matero, Ukwimi Refuges Church, and Kaunda Square congregations, to mention a few. His leadership extended beyond the pulpit as he took on significant roles within the church. Zulu not only impacted Nazarenes but also people and leaders of other denominations, as he acknowledged that we are all sons and daughters of God. In his interactions with non-Nazarenes, he however held onto the beliefs and values of the Church of the Nazarene.</p>

<p>In 1986, Zulu was elected as the District Superintendent of Zambia South District of the Church of the Nazarene, a position he held for 11 years. During this time, he actively worked to open new churches and preaching points; strengthened existing churches; and encouraged spiritual growth among members through, among other things, preaching and teaching holiness messages upon which the Church of the Nazarene grounds its doctrinal tenets.</p>

<p>It is said that John Zulu’s prayer during the 1987 District Assembly was that “the Lord will raise up men and women in the church to help reach the unreached for Christ,” reflecting his vision for the Church of the Nazarene’s mission. That vision might have been kindled following the Church’s Second Regional Conference held in Harare, Zimbabwe in that year (1987). That regional conference was organized by the able leadership of the Regional Director, Dr. Richard Zanner, and was presided over by the Church’s jurisdiction Superintendent, the late Dr. Charles Strickland.[8]</p>

<h3 id="ministry-to-mozambican-refugees">Ministry to Mozambican Refugees</h3>

<p>One notable achievement during Zulu’s leadership was the organization of over 430 Chewa-speaking Nazarenes among the refugees from Mozambique at the Ukwimi Settlement in Eastern Zambia in 1989. There was civil war in Mozambique which intensified from 1986 following the death of Mozambique’s state president, Samora Machel. Over a million Mozambicans fled their country to neighboring countries of Zambia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, and Eswatini. The Mozambican refugees in Zambia were organized into a congregation at Ukwimi Settlement by Rev. Zulu, who at one time was accompanied by Dr. Richard Zanner to minister to these people.[9]</p>

<p>Indeed, Zulu played a very crucial role in establishing congregations for these individuals, demonstrating his commitment to serving those in need. He pastored these refugees as though Ukwimi Refugee Settlement was close to his house in Lusaka, when in reality he travelled for hours just to share the gospel and encourage their faith in God. These people came from a country that was ravaged by war. Most had lost loved ones, as well as homes and possessions, and they were now living in a country not their own. Some might have lost all hope in life. However, for Zulu, it was a reminder of his belief that only in God do we have lasting hope. Hence, Rev. John and his wife Rosemary took it upon themselves to remind these refugees about God’s love, saying that He was and will always be in control, even in such devastating circumstances.</p>

<p>In doing all this, Zulu demonstrated God’s love by loving them and showing them the way to God their Father who cared for them through and through. With his care and ministry to them, hope was restored to the hapless and hopeless.</p>

<h3 id="church-growth-under-zulu">Church Growth Under Zulu</h3>

<p>Indeed, under John Zulu’s leadership and church administration, Zambia South District of the Church of the Nazarene registered significant growth. As a leader, he initiated and inspired new church planting, sending and supporting various pastors to open new churches in various suburbs within Lusaka and other towns and districts in Zambia Nazarene South District including Chipata, a town in Zambia’s Eastern province. His influence was felt by many, as he inspired and mentored emerging pastors and leaders in the Church of the Nazarene.</p>

<p>In 1993, John and Rosemary began pioneering an English-speaking church in Lusaka, which further showcased his dedication to expanding the reach of the gospel. With this initiative, Kaunda Square Church of the Nazarene was established.</p>

<p>As the Church at the Regional headquarters in South Africa recognized his leadership abilities, he was appointed to take charge of the Zambia North District in Kitwe. Therefore, in May 2002, Zulu was appointed District Superintendent for Zambia North District to oversee the growth and development projects of that District. This happened as there was a leadership vacuum in that part of Zambia’s Nazarene Church. After 2 years elapsed, Zulu was elected to continue as District Superintendent for the next 4 years in 2004. However, he only served a few months of those 4 years before his untimely death in June 2005.</p>

<p>While serving as District Superintendent of Zambia’s North District, Zulu worked tirelessly and diligently, shouldering Nazarene Compassionate Ministries (NCM) responsibilities in the district. The church become vibrant, as pastors and leaders were inspired and therefore motivated and emulated Zulu to serve the church wholeheartedly. Indeed, Zulu had great vision for the Christian gospel. As a leader, Zulu encouraged student pastors and personally supported them with whatever he had and urged them to keep on going.</p>

<p>Zulu was not only a preacher but also a church planter and spiritual mentor to countless individuals throughout Zambia. For Zulu, his desire was to have more churches/preaching points established, and to have pastors who were able to start a church from nothing — planting and establishing new churches and congregations where they did not previously exist. This was premised on his ministry philosophy of “not having pastors scramble for the already existing churches and congregations.”</p>

<h3 id="influence-and-impact-upon-church-of-the-nazarene-and-christianity-in-general">Influence and Impact upon Church of the Nazarene and Christianity in General</h3>

<p>John Zulu’s ministerial service left an indelible mark on the Church of the Nazarene in Zambia, influencing countless individuals and shaping the future of the church in that part of Africa. His commitment to evangelism, church planting and growth, and ministerial training and formation were evident in his approach to ministry, which emphasized outreach and nurturing new believers.</p>

<p>During his service as District Superintendent in Zambia South District, Zulu encouraged a good number of young men and women to heed God’s call to ministry. As pointed out previously, many young men and women experienced the call to Christian service through the Church of the Nazarene under his influence. That impact continues to be felt today twenty years after his demise. And without a doubt it will continue in years and generations to come.</p>

<p>As part of his openness in his approach to ministry, Zulu loved children and believed that children should always be treated with love as a way of modeling love to them, so that when they would grow up, they would emulate this love for others. Whenever children saw him, they would be shouting <em>Abusa</em>! (Pastor!). And he would always spare some time to play and talk with them. And some of those kids are Christian ministers and leaders of Christian organizations today.</p>

<p>One such pastor, Rev. Neld Nkunika, currently serves as the District Superintendent for Church of the Nazarene Zambia South District and was among the young people who were inspired by Rev. Zulu. In his own words, Nkunika says he always admired Zulu’s ministry, philosophy, and approach. Nkunika remembers Zulu as “a great leader, preacher, evangelist, and spiritual mentor.”[10] Nkunika also suggests that the fact that some of John Zulu’s children married pastors is a further extending of Zulu’s legacy within the Church of the Nazarene and beyond.</p>

<p>Zulu also engaged ecumenically, collaborating with the pastors and church leaders of different denominations, including Roman Catholic, Pentecostal, Holiness, Reformed, Methodist, and UCZ, among others. Many denominations received his leading with warm welcome. He also associated with some church pastors who, together with him, invited some white Christian missionaries who came with the aim of assisting various churches to grow and develop in the 1990s.</p>

<p>For a man of his humble stature, it was not surprising that John Zulu was recognized for his significant, impactful contributions during Zambia South District Assembly held on October 21, 2018, where he was honored posthumously alongside other former district superintendents. The Assembly recognized his leadership and service, along with the contributions of Rev. Nicholas Chirwa (1st Superintendent) [11], Rev. Joe Lilema (3rd District Superintendent), Rev. John Kachaka (4th District Superintendent), and Rev. William Banda (5th District Superintendent). Zulu’s widow, Mrs. Rosemary Zulu, represented him during that meaningful recognition ceremony.</p>

<h3 id="madalitso-choir-one-of-zulus-unique-contributions">Madalitso Choir: One of Zulu’s Unique Contributions</h3>

<p>One of the most famous choirs within the Church of the Nazarene in Africa is Madalitso (Blessing) Choir, from Chilenje Church, which also bears witness to John Zulu’s influence and impact. This is a choir that began under his influence when he was the local church pastor. Indeed, it became very famous in the Church of the Nazarene and has maintained a strong reputation. In September 1987, the choir, under Zulu’s guidance, made significant sacrifices to raise funds to attend the Second African Regional Conference for the Church of the Nazarene in Harare, Zimbabwe.[12]</p>

<p>Furthermore, under Zulu’s leadership, and in collaboration with missionary Rev. Rowell Clark, the Madalitso Choir managed to raise funds yet again for their attendance of General Assembly in Indianapolis in 1989. The choir never missed Africa Regional Assemblies and inspired many through their music even to this date. Indeed, the Madalitso Choir is one of John Zulu’s lasting legacies.</p>

<p>His sudden passing on June 7, 2005, just before he was set to attend the Church’s General Assembly in Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, was a profound loss to the church and especially the choir. He had been asked yet again to go with the choir to the General Assembly, just to inspire other church leaders and to share about how he had managed to come with the choir in the 1980s. It should be emphasized that the Madalitso Choir belongs to Zambia South District of the Church of the Nazarene, and when the invitation was made, Zulu was the District Superintendent for Zambia North, stationed in Kitwe. However, the General Church made clear that Zulu was the one required to come with the Choir. His death brought devastation to the choir, who had to go to the General Assembly without him. However, his wife Rosemary was asked by Rev. Rowell Clark to accompany the choir, which she did, despite being in a period of bereavement for her husband.</p>

<h3 id="legacy">Legacy</h3>

<p>John Zulu fought the good fight, ran the race, and kept the faith. Long after death his legacy remains a guiding light for many within the Church of the Nazarene. Surely, Zulu’s life and ministry serve as an inspiration for future generations, and as a beacon of faith, reminding all of us today of the need for and importance of dedication, service, and leadership in fulfilling God’s mission in the world as God’s workmanship, created in Jesus Christ to do every good work.[13]</p>

<p>I argue here that Zulu’s life and ministry could be a watershed for many who would aspire to serve God without reservations and selfishness. His example offers insights into what it means to be a true leader and a church administrator and manager. If truth be told and comparison be put, a number of church leaders after John Zulu could not match up to his leadership capabilities. Therefore, writing passionately about the Church of the Nazarene severally, with Prophet Moses, I can only say that “May the LORD Himself raise up leaders among your people like unto me”[14]   who will lead the Church of the Nazarene without selfish motives; but with love, compassion, honesty, and skillful hands and integrity of heart.[15]</p>

<p>John Zulu’s life was woven into the fabric of the Church of the Nazarene and the community in which he was a part. Indeed, those who knew him share profound reflections and testimonials about his character, conduct, influence, and impact. His commitment to faith and service left an enduring impression on many who walked and worked alongside him in ministry.</p>

<p>Sophie Nyamwezi Zulu, his oldest daughter, often recalls the warmth and wisdom her father embodied. On June 7, 2021, she penned a heartfelt message, reflecting on the profound impact his absence has had on her life. She expressed that the day of his passing remains the most difficult for their family, a moment that transformed her from a child to an elder. In her words, she conveyed a deep longing for his leadership and presence, reminding us of the personal loss felt by those closest to him. Sophie writes as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Without being forced we used to have devotions every evening at 5pm where we were sharing a passage and sung together. It was times we all looked forward to without being forced. And “atate” (father), as our family priest would play the guitar so wonderfully. One thing I learnt from my father is how he showed the fruit of the Holy Spirit so effortlessly. He was such a self-less person with so much empathy for people. Another thing about him whenever he wanted a location for God, he would simply claim it by faith. In particular, I will talk about Livingstone. One day he was with his two sons-in-law at a time they had travelled to Livingstone, claiming that city for Jesus for the Church of the Nazarene. At that time there was no work for the Church of the Nazarene in Livingstone. He did the same for Kaunda Square until a Church was established there.[16]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rev. Neld Nkunika shared similar sentiments during the District Assembly on October 21, 2018. He remembered Zulu as a mentor who significantly influenced his spiritual journey and that of many others. Rev. Nkunika’s acknowledgment of Zulu’s mentorship reveals the deep respect held by those who had the privilege to serve alongside him and to be served by him. Nkunika noted how Zulu’s encouragement inspired him and others, including the late Pastor Patrick Kayombo and Rev. Daison Mbewe, to pursue theology and serve the church faithfully. Indeed, Mbewe and Nkunika are serving the Church of the Nazarene in Zambia South District.</p>

<p>Testimonials of people from various churches recall specific moments that highlight Zulu’s undoubted dedication. His involvement in local outreach initiatives brought hope to many who were struggling, showing that faith in action can transform lives. I have already indicated on how different denominations and Christian faith groups came together to do ministry in one accord. Zulu’s influence, impact, and service was not confined within the bounds of the Church of the Nazarene in Zambia.</p>

<p>The legacy of John Zulu extends far beyond his years of service. Indeed, it continues to inspire and guide the Church of the Nazarene and its members in Zambia and beyond. Commenting on Zulu’s lasting legacy, Rev. Paul Mtambo says, “We are standing on his shoulders. He established a firm ground for the church in Zambia. I loved Rev. Zulu very much and I still remember and cherished some illustrations he used to explain holiness sermons.”[17] For his part, Rev. Gary Sidle shares the following impressions about John Zulu:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When we first arrived in Zambia, he was one of the key leaders who graciously helped us to adjust to life and ministry there. He took me on my first Jesus Film trip, visited a home village in Eastern Zambia, and was always joyously encouraging me and Rev. Penney. We are so thankful to the Zulu family and their faithfulness to serve the Lord in so many ways.[18]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Rev. Wilfred Yambayamba, says “Zulu has done a great ministry in building God’s Church.”[19]</p>

<p>Indeed, Zulu’s dedication to the gospel and commitment to discipleship laid a strong foundation for future generations of believers, establishing a lasting legacy and influence on the Church of the Nazarene’s growth and development.</p>

<p>In summary, John Zulu’s legacy is not solely defined by his titles and achievements. It is enriched by the countless lives he touched through his actions, teachings, and love for God. As those who knew him reflect on their experiences, it becomes clear that his impact was felt not just in the church but in the community at large.</p>

<p>In every story shared, the common thread remains that John Zulu was a man of God whose life exemplified faith, compassion, and commitment to serving others. His memory lives on in the hearts of those he influenced, encouraging them to continue the work he expanded in Zambia from the late 1970s till his death in 2005. Indeed, Zulu was a great and yet humble servant of God. Posterity will continue to learn something about his service in the Church of the Nazarene, within the community of believers, and beyond the borders of Zambia.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>In addition to his role planting churches and nurturing and training future leaders, John Zulu’s influence also reached the wider community, where he demonstrated the importance of faith in action. His commitment to social responsibility was evident in his outreach efforts, such as with the Mozambiquan refugees and his work with the Madalitso Choir. His efforts to support the choir showcased not only his belief in their ministry but also his understanding of the church’s role in uplifting those who cannot uplift themselves. In so doing, Zulu was inculcating in the people values of self-worth, self-supporting stamina among the church members, and teaching and modeling that we are to diligently work and that the Lord blesses the labors of our hands.</p>

<p>Responding to God’s call into ministry at 22 years of age, John Zulu’s journey through life was marked by faith, dedication to service, and a profound love for God and His Church. From his humble beginnings in 1950 to his impactful ministry that spanned about three decades, until his death in 2005, Zulu served God faithfully while raising a family of six children.</p>

<p>In summary, the enduring legacy, impact, and influence of Rev. John Zulu is not just a historical account. Rather, it is a living legacy that continues to inspire the Church of the Nazarene today. Indeed, his life and ministry serve as a powerful reminder of the impact one individual can have on the Church and beyond. As current and future leaders strive to emulate his commitment to service, the teachings and example of Rev. John Zulu will remain a guiding light for generations to come. Therefore, in reflecting on his legacy, we are called to honor his memory by carrying forth the mission he embraced so wholeheartedly: to spread the love of Christ, to empower others, and to lead with faith and integrity.</p>
