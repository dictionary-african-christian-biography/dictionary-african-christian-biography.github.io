        <!-- CONTENT -->
        <p>Elphas Odwisah Wambani lived his life  for the success of others, toiling to make known the name of Christ but living  it within the cultural constraints imposed on him. He traversed churches and  borders, was liked by many for his industry and tireless work for the good of  all. He saw hope and unity where others saw despair. In a region stooped in  superstition and witchcraft he focused his energies in redefining his people’s  world view and bridging the chasm between Christianity and culture.</p>

<p>Wambani was born in 1956, the firstborn in  a family of eight, to Sokhera and Robai Wambani.  He later married Juliet Wambani and the couple  was blessed with six children: Tom, Lucy, Jerry, Sheila, Siovi and Irene. He  was Kenyan of the Luhya tribe, from Banyala clan of Abaengere kinship. He  spoke fluent Kinyala, Kiswahili and English.</p>

<p>Wambani was born in a very poor family  and his early life was characterized by struggle. For example, he had to walk  many kilometers a day in order to gain a basic education. His family moved back  and forth between Kenya and Uganda in search for a better living standard. In  his own words “my father was irresponsible and abusive but, our family  rituals and celebrations kept us together.” His mother became a Quaker, while his  father remained a traditionalist for a long time. His mother learned the Quaker  views and their values concerning work, the role of women, and the importance  of education. Her diligence in living out these new values eventually influenced her  husband to espouse those values and views as well.[1]</p>

<p>Wambani was torn between two spiritual traditions, traditional cultural  beliefs and practices and the growing influence of the Quaker faith in his  life. Having experienced how illiteracy held his parents back, he became  determined to be educated. Even at a young age he saw the power and value  of education and had to endure many hardships during a time that he  characterized as a painful period in his life. Wambani  eventually went to live with uncles who assisted him in gaining his primary  school education. He later went to secondary school and exceled despite  spending half of his school time at home because he could not pay his fees. Wambani  eventually became a teacher. As he pursued his education, however, he  frequently went without shoes and  food in order to provide for his siblings so that they could follow in his  footsteps to become literate and receive an education.</p>

<p>Wambani resisted the temptation of a  carefree life and dedicated his life to seeing others gain the precious  knowledge he struggled to get by making  it easier for them. He brought both the school and church closer home. He was the  epitome of the adage “charity begins at home.” Unlike young men his age, he did  not marry as soon as he began earning an income. Rather, he became the laughing  stock of the village when he chose to remain single and save his money. At one  time it was whispered among his friends that he was not even able to father a  child. Though not short of admirers among the women of his village, he kept  them all at an arm’s length because of his Christian values.</p>

<p>Wambani was very active as a youth leader  in his local Friends Church of Chebuyusi Village Meeting. He was also  instrumental in the planting of the Nauulu Village Meeting. There, he fought  hard to see the Meeting receive a primary school in order to mitigate the long  distances his needed to travel to get the much needed education and bolster the  social status of the area. He organized numerous fundraising meetings to build  the church which today stands as evidence to his tireless efforts to help  others have a better life.</p>

<p>Though  a teacher by profession Wambani struggled for eight years to find a ministerial  vocation.[2] He later enrolled  at Kenya Highlands Bible College, mingling with and encouraging students from  diverse ethnic, cultural, and social backgrounds to give reality to what he  considered authentic Christian living: organizing small groups and helping others  become comfortable having “taboo” discussions on subjects like HIV/AIDS, which  was just breaking out at the time and could only be talked about in hushed  tones because of the stigma associated with the illness.</p>

<p>Wambani’s teaching career awakened the  desire to study how indigenous tribes would celebrate the spirit and how this  could find accommodation within Quaker worship. This was a tall order given the  misconceptions and misunderstanding that existed between the traditionalists  and the mainstream churches at the time. Wambani sought to examine how the  Banyala employed their worship in different stages of life and the role of  special events like naming, circumcision, burials, <em>makumbusho</em> (remembrance of the dead), and <em>okhufua</em> (giving of gifts to the departed),  while at the same time paying attention to the  existing tensions within the Christian church. He sought to blend  traditional ways of life with Quaker teachings  and practices. Wambani noted in his dissertation that “the traditional Banyala  cultural celebration of the spirit did not resonate very well with the Quaker  understanding of spirituality.” The Banyala stressed the role of spirits and  venerated the ancestors in the life of the community. These practices made it  difficult for missionaries to reconcile the work of the Spirit and that of  venerated ancestors.[3]</p>

<p>Wambani embraced the philosophy of  addition rather than exclusion, making space for people experiencing the Spirit  in every possible way. This might have opened doors to syncretism but he helped  draw an awareness to the need to explore further the cultural practices vis-à-vis  western Christianity and properly define what really is an authentic African  Christian experience.[4] His ideas came at a time when the church was  struggling the post-independence syndrome and was very intolerant of new ideas.  He blazed a road that very few dared to walk as he challenged the church in  matters of faith. This was a time when theological interpretation of cultural  beliefs and practices was being advocated for by indigenous independent churches  yet at the same time was being shunned by denominational churches. Wambani’s roots  and first-hand understanding of traditional “special events,” as he called traditional  rites and rituals, made his insights significant in unmasking the myths and misconceptions  about African traditions and integrating African spirituality into the orthodox  praxis of Christianity.[5]</p>

<p>Though a Quaker, Wambani worked very  well with other denominations in the region. He became an especially popular  speaker among the African Independent Churches where he authoritatively spoke  on African spirituality. A friend he met in Cambridge, Massachusetts while  studying for his Doctor of Ministry degree at The Episcopal Divinity School  would write that, “his [Wambani’s] presence was God’s gift to us; he spoke  God’s word to us and we learned much from his deep connection with spirit and  his ability to interpret that spirit in human terms. At the same time he was  eager to listen to that of God in us, to learn what we would say of our  experience of the truth. Divine love was surely shared through him.”[6] This  explains why, though shunned by the local Quaker church, Wambani still remained  a member of the Meeting, helping the Quakers plant more churches because his  actions resonated well with the Quaker belief, “that of God in every human  being.”</p>

<p>Known  for his knack for initiating community based projects, Wambani, together with  others  like Pasliano, Maparo, and Makokha  Ford, started a local football team, the Munache Football Club. Wambani carefully  crafted name as he used his ingenuity to bring together both young and old from  the three locations of Musavale, Nauulu, and Chebuyusi. The team has now survived  three generations of players tapping talent and fostering community,  cooperation, and unity. Together with Amos Oyalo and Livingstone Oyalo, Wambani  started a soccer youth tournament or <em>esiovi</em> (war cry), which was played every December. The tournament brought together  many young people from the Bunyala, Wanga, and Bukusu communities in order to  foster unity and showcase their talent. This bumpy patch of ground at Sidikho  Primary school has since been graced by national football heroes like Roy  Biketi and Pan Paper.</p>

<p>The  greatest gain from the football club and tournament has been that it kept  keeping the youth of the area from mischief they would have otherwise indulged  in and has been a big factor in the reduction of drug related crime. The  football club has been a way to help curb the spread of HIV AIDS. Finally, it became  a tool to galvanize the population and create social capital and improve the  social status of the people. Wambani noted  that AIDS continued to cripple most of Kenya, “It is really a disaster.”[7] His  work with the football club highlights his resourcefulness for working with  nearly nothing to produce something that would benefit all. Wambani endeavored  to continue to bring AIDS into the focus of the community and help the church  develop proper support groups that would help alleviate the suffering of the  local poor who had contracted the disease and who had both been isolated by their  community and given a death sentence. The resounding question Wambani brought  to the forefront was, “what is our Christian response to the scourge?”</p>

<p>Wambani  epitomizes the African spirit of embracing all. One of his friends who visited  Wambani’s family after his death would wrote, “seeing the close knit community  and the people’s practice of hospitality caused us to reflect on our own  society.”[8] He further noted that, “Hospitality is very different in a subsistence  farming community with no car and no electricity.  Visiting with each  other comes naturally and time is usually no problem. In contrast, we Americans  have found countless ways to insulate ourselves from each other.  We are  constantly in a rush.  The result is that we tend to not know our  neighbors or even members of our church very well.  Building community and  relationships is counter cultural.  It takes deliberate effort and  choice.   It is one of the major challenges facing All Saints’  Church. I know that there are times when we legitimately can not slow  down.  Even so, I encourage all of us to consider making a commitment to  be community here at All Saints’.  It will take some time and possibly  mean participating in something new.   The benefit is that this  community can better hold you and keep you even in the busiest times of the  year.”[9]</p>

<p>Wambani’s  interaction with the West and inviting outsiders to witness first hand African  social strata awakened the desire among many Westerners to relate better with  one another. Wambani’s fired would emphasize the brokenness of relationships in  the West noting that, “in a western world shredded by capitalism and  individualism.”[10] This is one great contribution the African church can give  to the world: showing how men and women can live together in unity and complement  each other. One of Wambani’s acquaintances also observed that, “he has also  provided me an opportunity to reflect again on the spiritual culture in which  we live…he noted that we tend to compartmentalize our religious lives.”[11] There  is no distinction between the spiritual and the physical worlds among the  Banyala, they intertwine with one another to make one whole influencing each  other uniquely.</p>

<p>Nan Hardison, a missionary who  oversees operations at St. Philip’s, noted Wambani’s unique perspective on issues  said, “we hired Elphas first as a teacher, then later made him dean of students,  when he arrived at St. Philip’s, ‘the college was in the dust bin,’ Elphas had  said, laughing, ‘Nobody admired it.’” Hardison credits Wambani for improving  St. Philip’s academics and boosting enrollment; it is now one of the top  colleges in the country.[12]</p>

<p>Wambani believed that everyone had  something to learn from everyone else. He, together with teachers Elizabeth  Grumbach and Carolyn Garth, collaborated to start an exchange program between  Moses Brown students in Massachusetts and those of Chebuyusi village in  Kakamega Western Kenya. Through the program, they exchanged photos and letters in  order to broaden their worldview and learn to appreciate other people’s  lifestyles. The exchange program also helped some of the participants realize  that there are things that people often take for granted which others can only  dream about. “I think it’s exciting to have a friend in Kakamega or in any  different place because you can learn a lot about other places that you didn’t  know about,” wrote fourth grade student Abigail L. Britt D., another fourth  grade student said at a Friends’ Meeting, “I have seen Chebuyusi village school  (on Google Earth) and that is where my friend Kevin goes to school. I think he  isn’t having an easy life but he is having a good life.”[13] Kevin, however, is  content with life and thankful for the other privileges that life has brought  his way.</p>

<p>The words of Holly Lyman Antolini sum it very well, "A Quaker Christian and traditionalist; both a Munyala  tribesman and a Kenyan; a man of many languages – Olunyala, Kiswahili, English;  a man imbued with respect for women  and  other people’s way of life a Quaker who taught in an Anglican seminary and  befriended Jews; a man from an illiterate family who completed a doctorate; a  rural Kenyan who studied in the US; a man from a culture that reviles gay and  lesbian people who made profound friendships among his gay and lesbian  colleagues at Episcopal Divinity School; he bridged chasms of differences many  would simply have fallen into or gone to war over.  In so doing, he  brought people to mutual understanding despite their manifold visceral and  instinctive resistances and differences.  Instead buckling over the dreadful  hollow of his own difficult upbringing and allowing it to fester in shame and  defeat, he embraced the humility of his own humanity, his disorientation in the  face of so many successive waves of the new and unfamiliar only spared him on  to learn more . He chose the hollow of a quiet confidence in Light of the  Spirit in every person that lies at the heart of the Quaker faith.  In the  hollow of his own humanity, he made a space for all the rest of us struggling  human beings to realize our own potential for holiness."[14]</p>

<p>It is only after Wambani exits this life that we can really appreciate his  contribution to the growth of Christianity in Chebuyusi, Bunyala, Kakamega,  Kenya, Africa, and the World in general.</p>
