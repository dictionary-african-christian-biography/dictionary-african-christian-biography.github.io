<img src="/images/editorial-committee/wariboko-nimi.jpg" class="bio" />
<strong>Dr. Nimi Wariboko</strong>, Chair, Executive Committee, is the Walter G. Muelder Professor of Social Ethics at Boston University School of Theology. He holds a PhD in Ethics (Suma Cum Laude) from Princeton Theological Seminary, an MBA in Finance and Accounting from Columbia University in New York City, and a B.Sc. (Economics, first class honors) from University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria. A lively transdisciplinary thinker, Dr. Wariboko loves to unfold, refold, enfold, and energize past and present ideas and hopes in relation to the possibilities of future human flourishing. The five pillars of his scholarship are economic ethics, Christian social ethics, African social traditions, Pentecostal studies, and philosophical theology. The structure of this creative body of work, which is characterized by rigorous interweaving of original insights from each of these fields, is mapped out by the following five central titles. <em>The Principle of Excellence: A Framework for Social Ethics</em> presents social ethics as action-provoking-and-guiding theories of praxis and actualization of potentialities for a more flourishing, inclusive, and creatively reconciled society; the focus of <em>God and Money: A Theology of Money in a Globalizing World</em> is a call for an alternative, inclusive global monetary system that can better support developing economies; <em>Ethics and Time: Ethos of Temporal Orientation in Politics and Religion of the Niger Delta</em> explores the emancipatory core of African culture; <em>The Pentecostal Principle: Ethical Methodology in New Spirit</em> develops a pneumatological methodology of ethics for public policies in pluralistic communities that are open to God’s Spirit; and <em>Economics in Spirit and Truth: A Moral Philosophy of Finance</em> situates a social justice-oriented “care of the soul” at the intersection of radical continental philosophy, economics, and politics to craft an ethics of antifragility and potent freedom that might counter the fragilities unleashed against our socio-economic fabric by late capitalism or global finance capital.</p>

In 2013, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Divinity by Berkeley Divinity School at Yale for his contribution to the study and understanding of world Christianity. He has served as President of several academic associations, including the American Society of Missiology (ASM), the Association of Professors of Mission (APM), and the International Association for Mission Studies (IAMS). He has served on the editorial board of the Oxford Studies in World Christianity series since 2006, and is current President of the [Korean] Global Mission Leadership Forum. In 2005, in collaboration with Yale Divinity School Library, he spearheaded the online database “Researching World Christianity: Doctoral Dissertations on Mission Since 1900.” In 1995, in addition to founding the <em>Dictionary of African Christian Biography</em>, he created an electronic index for his Ida Grace McRuer Missions Resource Centre’s collection of mission-related serials, a collection that was relocated to the University of Edinburgh in 1997, and then to Liverpool Hope University in 2008 where it is now part of the Andrew F. Walls Centre for the Study of Christianity in Africa and Asia. He has published five books, more than one hundred scholarly articles and book chapters, numerous reviews and editorials, and is the editor of seven collaborative volumes. His best-known book is <em>Missions and Money: Affluence as a Western Missionary Problem</em> (Orbis: 1st edition 1991, 13 printings; 2nd edition 2007, 3 printings), translated into Korean and Burmese. He is editor of the <em>Encyclopedia of Missions and Missionaries</em>, Volume 9 in Routledge’s Religion and Society Series (2007).  He and his wife, Jean, are active members of the Fort Garry Mennonite Fellowship in Winnipeg. During the 49 years of their marriage, their home has become home to a number of refugees, “illegal” immigrants, needy young adults, and a number of children and other folks who have needed a temporary or longer term place to call “home.” The net result today is a family on a modest traditional Mennonite scale, with “relatives” everywhere. He lectures part time at the Canadian Mennonite University in Winnipeg, and is an active member of his church’s Refugee Welcoming Committee, now serving a recently-arrived family of five from Syria.</p>
