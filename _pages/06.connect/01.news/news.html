      <p><strong>Received August 14, 2018 from Mr. Vernon Taylor</strong></p> <p>Dear sirs,</p> <p>I found your publication after searching for a name almost on a whim; it is odd how random things pop into the head of a person. I attended a village school near Newark in the English county of Nottinghamshire until I was ten years old. In 1960, or thereabouts, when I was seven our school was visited by a trainee missionary from the nearby Kelham Monastery. I was home sick in bed on the day of the visit but later I heard how a very tall and very black Zulu had visited the school and talked to the class.The following week the school made a return visit to the monastery and enjoyed a guided tour, unfortunately the tall Zulu had left for his "posting" a few days before and I never had the chance to meet him. The entire class was instructed to write a letter of thanks to our missionary friend and he did reply to every letter.</p> <p>I still have his reply to me somewhere. The last time I saw it the paper was delicate and worn but still quite legible.I still sometimes wonder about him and how he has fared in the almost sixty years since I was a small boy. The man's name was Isaac Dlamini. His address was simply: Dam Site, Pongola Port, Zululand.If he is still alive I am sure he would be at least 80 years old.I include the following link in case you are interested in learning a little about the <a href="https://ordinariatepilgrim.wordpress.com/2014/10/08/clergy-formation-the-kelham-way/">Kelham Hall Monastery</a></p> <p>Sincerely, <br>Vernon Taylor</p>

      <p><strong>Received February 12, 2018, from T. P. Masimba</strong></p><p>Heavenly regards.</p><p>I'm a young man aged 25. I'm a Minister of the Gospel. I work as a local Missionary in Zimbabwe under a Christian Organisation called African Enterprise founded by Dr Michael Cassidy in 1962. I come from Chivhu in Zimbabwe which was formerly called Charter District during the Rhodesian era. I graduated in Church Foundational Theology (a course which includes some basics in Meaningful Church Services, Building Young Disciples, Homiletics &amp; Building A Growing Church). However, I was interested in an article written about the Johane Masowe Movement by Robert Reese a former Missionary to Zimbabwe &amp; a consultant with World Missions Associates in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.Firstly it's really interesting &amp; inspiring. Also I request to know if there are any articles related to the Masowe Theology, the Meaning of their so-called "Momnage Language",  the meaning of their esoteric language &amp; Prophecy. If Dr R. Reese had supplied these in his article, he would have made a best-written record about this Johane Masowe Christian Faith.</p> <p>If your organisation was to rewrite history &amp; make a story of a lifetime, perhaps a million dollar story, then I implore you to visit this man for recording, documentation &amp; insight. His Ministry confirms many features of our Bible Theologies of which I find it very stunning as a young Bible Scholar. By visiting him, you'll relive the Days when our Lord Jesus Christ walked this earth during His earthly Ministry Days.This young Prophet with an esoteric name pronounced as "Edbone" has been used by God to do remarkable Supernatural Things by God's Power. Three visits to his Holy Ground will enrich your Theology in so many ways. This man is ushering in a New Dispensation in the Johane Masowe Christian Faith.</p><p>Thank you for your articles &amp; Gospel Missions around the world. God Richly Bless you.</p><p>Yours in the same Gospel Vineyard,<br> T. P. Masimba<</p>

      <p><strong>Received February 20, 2014, from Sophie Imasiku (Zambia):</strong></p><p>I was born and grew up here in Zambia at a place called Mambilima in the Luapula province of Zambia. This morning, I took an internet search for our former missionaries who opened up our area for Christianity known as the Open Brethren (Christian Missions in Many Lands). I came across our well-known missionary there by the name of <a href="{{site.url}}/stories/zambia/lammond-william/">William Lammond</a> (1876 to 1968). The entire fraternity there knew him by the name of "Bwana Lamya" because he brought "electricity" to the area which is still there until this day. We are lucky that our place is on the banks of the Luapula river and particularly that the "Mambilima" is the local name for the rapids, meaning " the jumping of the waters. It was formerly called, as you may be aware, "Johnstone Falls" for a number of years from about the early 1920s until my country Zambia attained independence on 24th October 1964. We are actually celebrating 50 years of our independence this year.</p><p>My late father--May his Soul rest in peace--was a teacher at the same place and we all grew up and got educated in the same CMML faith.</p><p>As a young girl, I knew a lot about Bwana Lammond,especially his 3rd wife Betty Shepherd and her sister who worked as teachers there at Johnston Falls primary School. Most of the people who were and some who are still in the present government here were educated there at the famous Johnstone Falls primary School run by the CMML brethren. they did a lot to develop the area and they built a big hospital which has now modern facilities like a theatre and mortunary, a school for the blind, the area is known for blind children and also a school for the handicapped children. I give great credit to these pioneers for bringing not only Christianity but enormous literacy to that impoverished area.</p><p>I am now a grown up woman with three grown up children. I work here at the Zambian Open University as Administrative Assistant to the Bursar, here in the capital city of Lusaka.</p><p>My sincere thanks to D.A.C.B for their remarkable input, <br>SOPHIE CHIBALE IMASIKU (MS)</p><p><em>Read the story of William Lammond <a href="{{site.url}}/stories/zambia/lammond-william/">HERE</a>.</em></p>
