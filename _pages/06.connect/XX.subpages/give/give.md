**Financial Support**

Although the DACB has been, since 2012, a digital project affiliated with the [Center for Global Christianity and Mission](https://www.bu.edu/cgcm/) at Boston University, its financial needs, staff salaries, and publications are funded almost entirely by donations.  

The DACB needs the ongoing support of friends. Please consider making a donation or a multi-year pledge to the project. 100% of your gift will directly support the DACB and is tax deductible (US donors). Please see our [Stories](/sort/stories/latest-sort/), [Projects](/projects/), [Resources](/resources/) and [Journal](/journal/) section of our website to see the impact of your gift.

Thank you, from the heart!
