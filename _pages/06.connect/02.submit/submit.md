In the urgent task of documenting the story of African Christianity before it is lost to human memory, the DACB is committed to collecting and preserving:

Follow the guidelines for submitting **biographies** intended for the DACB in section A below. Guidelines for formatting and content are found in our [Instructional Manual for Researchers and Writers]({{site.url}}/resources/final_instr_manual.pdf).  
2) The histories of religious movements, churches, and Christian communities. Guidelines for submitting **Christian histories** are in section B below.

## A. Biographies (DACB)

### Choice of Biographical Subjects

As you choose biographical subjects for your research, please take into account the following guidelines:  

1\. Subjects whose stories already appear in the _DACB_ will normally not be considered, unless the proposed article gives significant new material and insight. Therefore it is important to consult the _DACB_ either online or at a _DACB_ participating institution, to ascertain whether or not the _DACB_ already has stories on your proposed subjects.  
2\. Your subjects need not be confined to professional clerics, missionaries, or theologians, but might include laypersons from various walks of life whose stories are essential to an understanding of the church in Africa.  
3\. General suggested length: no longer than 3,000 words and no shorter than 500 words.  
4\. As the intent and purpose of the _DACB_ is to record the history of African Christianity, we ask that you focus on writing the stories of **deceased** subjects.  
5\. It is the policy of _DACB_ **NOT** to publish the stories of living subjects. In very few cases, exceptions have been made if the subjects are (a) of a very venerable age (over 70) and (b) they have retired from all active ministry (in other words, their story is complete). Stories of living subjects will be kept on file in the _DACB_ office for future use.

We invite contributions from individuals affiliated with religious and educational institutions in Africa and elsewhere.

### Guidelines for Article Contributors

The JACB is an academic journal devoted to the preservation, publication and dissemination of original scholarly articles relating to African Christian biographical subjects. The journal is not hagiographical, and subjects are treated with candor and honesty while at the same time acknowledging and appreciating the subject‚Äôs contribution(s) to Christianity in Africa at local, regional, denominational, national, or continental levels. Articles on local, regional, or national church histories are also welcome, as are critical reviews of publications related to African Christian biography.

Biographies that are not prepared with academic objectivity, rigor, and care will not be published, except possibly as examples of hagiography. In addition to the quality of the text itself, each article should include appropriately supportive endnotes, including documentation of time and location of interviews. Brief supportive bibliographies, when available, should be included.

**Preparing and submitting article manuscripts**

**Format**. Manuscripts (including endnotes) should be single-spaced, using a 12-point common font such as Times New Roman, with one-inch margins. Manuscripts should ideally be submitted as MS Word documents, and sent to the editor as email attachments.  Articles should be from 3,000 to 5,000 words in length, including notes.

**Author identification**. Please include with your article a brief biographical note indicating your present position (with full name and location of your academic institution).
