In the urgent task of documenting the story of African Christianity before it is lost to human memory, the DACB is committed to collecting and preserving:      
1) The biographies of African men and women, both lay people and clergy, who have played a significant role in the birth and growth of Christianity over the entire continent, from the time of Jesus to the present. Follow the guidelines for submitting **biographies** intended for the DACB in section A below. Guidelines for formatting and content are found in our [Instructional Manual for Researchers and Writers]({{site.url}}/resources/final_instr_manual.pdf).  
2) The histories of religious movements, churches, and Christian communities. Guidelines for submitting **Christian histories** are in section B below.
3) The DACB disseminates this biographical data for use in educational and church settings using the *Journal of African Christian Biography*. Guidelines for submitting to the JACB are in section C below.  

Email all submissions (see section D below) to Dr. Michèle Sigg, Executive Director, [DACB@BU.edu](mailto:dacb@bu.edu)

## A. Biographies (DACB)

### Choice of Biographical Subjects

As you choose biographical subjects for your research, please take into account the following guidelines:  

1\. Subjects whose stories already appear in the _DACB_ will normally not be considered, unless the proposed article gives significant new material and insight. Therefore it is important to consult the _DACB_ either online or at a _DACB_ participating institution, to ascertain whether or not the _DACB_ already has stories on your proposed subjects.  
2\. Your subjects need not be confined to professional clerics, missionaries, or theologians, but might include laypersons from various walks of life whose stories are essential to an understanding of the church in Africa.  
3\. General suggested length: no longer than 3,000 words and no shorter than 500 words.  
4\. As the intent and purpose of the _DACB_ is to record the history of African Christianity, we ask that you focus on writing the stories of **deceased** subjects.  
5\. It is the policy of _DACB_ **NOT** to publish the stories of living subjects. In very few cases, exceptions have been made if the subjects are (a) of a very venerable age (over 70) and (b) they have retired from all active ministry (in other words, their story is complete). Stories of living subjects will be kept on file in the _DACB_ office for future use.

## C. Submissions to the *Journal of African Christian Biography (JACB)*

The *Journal of African Christian Biography* (JACB) publishes research on biographies of African Christians. The primary focus is on the role of local agents in the spread of Christianity in Africa. The JACB is an open access publication committed to facilitating global conversations among scholars across cultures, nations, Christian traditions, and academic specializations, with particular emphasis on Africa. We invite contributions from individuals affiliated with religious and educational institutions in Africa and elsewhere.   

CONTENT includes:   
 *	Original biographies and African Christian histories   
 *	Biographies highlighted from the DACB website    
 *	Obituaries and tributes about recently deceased figures   
 *	Excerpts of recently published scholarship    
 *	Interviews with select African church leaders and scholars (still living)   
 *	Resources for teaching with biography    
 *	Reviews of scholarship on African Christian biography and history

### Guidelines for Article Contributors

The JACB is an academic journal devoted to the preservation, publication and dissemination of original scholarly articles relating to African Christian biographical subjects. The journal is not hagiographical, and subjects are treated with candor and honesty while at the same time acknowledging and appreciating the subject’s contribution(s) to Christianity in Africa at local, regional, denominational, national, or continental levels. Articles on local, regional, or national church histories are also welcome, as are critical reviews of publications related to African Christian biography.

Biographies that are not prepared with academic objectivity, rigor, and care will not be published, except possibly as examples of hagiography. In addition to the quality of the text itself, each article should include appropriately supportive endnotes, including documentation of time and location of interviews. Brief supportive bibliographies, when available, should be included.

**Preparing and submitting article manuscripts**

**Format**. Manuscripts (including endnotes) should be single-spaced, using a 12-point common font such as Times New Roman, with one-inch margins. Manuscripts should ideally be submitted as MS Word documents, and sent to the editor as email attachments.  Articles should be from 3,000 to 5,000 words in length, including notes.

**Author identification**. Please include with your article a brief biographical note indicating your present position (with full name and location of your academic institution).

**E-mail address**. Some authors desire to include their e-mail address with their article. Please indicate whether or not you wish to have your email address included with your author identification.

**Author photo**. Please provide a recent digital head and shoulders photograph of yourself to be published with your article.

**Photographs**. The JACB welcomes photographs with articles. Please send these to us as JPEG digital files.

### Suggested Interview Guidelines and Questions for the Journal of African Christian Biography

The JACB seeks to engage with contemporary African Christian theologians, Christian leaders, and scholars through the use of interviews. The following guidelines are meant to help structure the process.  

A\.	**Preparation**
  1.	Who is the person you want to interview?
  2.	What is your relationship to him or her? The questions you ask will emerge from what you already know.
  3.	Why do you what to interview this person?
      i.	What do you already know about this person?
      ii.	What is it about this person that makes him or her a notable subject for the JACB?

B\.	**Interview questions and the Interview itself**. The interview can be conducted face to face or by email correspondence. Usually a combination of both methods is ideal. Questions should be open-ended, and should be tailored to fit the person who is being interviewed.
  1.	Can you share something of your family background, childhood, education?
  2.	Where did you grow up, and what were the circumstances of your upbringing?
  3.	Were there individuals (parents, siblings, spouse, relatives, friends, teachers, mentors, role models) who particularly influenced you? What was it about them that made an impact on you?
  4.	Were there events, circumstances or books that were somehow pivotal in your life?
  5.	What were some of the greatest challenges/obstacles that you encountered in becoming who you are?
  6.	What do you feel were your most significant accomplishments?
  7.	Do you have any regrets?
  8.	What are your concerns for Africa (or for your church, your country) as you contemplate the future?
  9.	What are your dreams and hopes for the Church in Africa? If you were to return to this continent 100 years from now, what would you hope to find? What would you fear you might find?
  10.	Do you have words of advice for readers of the JACB?

C\.	**Processing the interview**
  1.	Whether the interview has been conducted by email or face to face, read through the responses carefully, and flag points that need to be clarified or expanded upon.
  2.	When you return the text to the interviewee for approving, invite the person to address the points that you have flagged for elaboration or clarification.

D\.	**Postscript to the interview**: Please send a mini-bio of yourself, the time frame within which the interview was conducted, and—if the interviewee is a published author—a list of key publications.

E\.	**Publishing the interview**. Once the interviewee has approved of the interview, submit it to the DACB/JACB editorial offices in Boston. The interview will appear in the JACB which will be published on the DACB website.

F\.	The DACB will provide the interviewee with multiple (10) copies of the JACB issue in which the interview appears, accompanied by a letter of thanks that will be copied to you the interviewer.
