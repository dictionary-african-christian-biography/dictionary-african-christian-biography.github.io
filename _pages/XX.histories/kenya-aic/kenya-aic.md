<a name="abc"></a>**African Brotherhood Church (ABC)**  

This church was founded in 1945 by Rev. Simeon Mulandi Kaasya formerly a Captain with the Salvation Army and the Gospel Furthering Fellowship (GFF). It started in Nairobi as the Akamba Christian Union in the GFF Church led by George Rhoads with Rev. Mulandi as his associate Pastor. The African Brotherhood Church has spread to most parts of Kenya and other African nations.

The ABC attracted some excommunicated members from the AIM in Ukambani because they accommodated some Akamba traditional practices that were not tolerated in the AIM and some other missions. The church also gained popularity because it aimed to restore the Akamba brotherhood lost during the colonial period and the coming of missionaries whom they accused of adversely affecting the Akamba brotherhood. The ABC started schools and hospitals which largely attracted the Akamba people and provided scholarships for individuals to attend theological seminaries so they could provide spiritual nourishment for the church. The restoration of some aspects of the Akamba traditional practices consistent with Christianity such as dowry payment and traditional marriage ceremonies, to mention a few, made the church popular. The ABC affiliated itself with the Mau Mau and the Kenyan nationalist groups opposed to the colonial government. Consequently, it is classified as a nationalist African Instituted Church. The church has a million followers and has spread to Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Congo and Zambia. The church partners with local NGOs to address development issues, education needs, the perennial food security problems and poverty in the region.

<a name="mulembe"></a>**African Ministry of Jesus Christ (_Mulembe_ Church)**  

In 1957 a splinter group from the Anglican Church of Kenya started this church that was initially called the Church of Christ in Africa with Matayo Ocholla as its first bishop. The church originally included members from both the Dholuo and Luyha communities. However, between 1968 and 1970 the leaders of the Church of Christ in Africa were involved in conflicts which ended up in court. As a result, the two communities formed their own splinter groups, the Dholuo calling their church Johera and the Luyha naming theirs African Ministry of Jesus Christ (_Mulembe_ Church).  

The _Mulembe_ Church is a charismatic African church which accommodates African religious worship and rituals. It has many celebrations which include the Easter holiday, _Ukumbusho_, the harvest, the day they formed their splinter group, and many others. These celebration days are marked with drama and dances accompanied by African instruments. It has had many followers in Western Kenya. Accommodation of African traditional practices like polygamy, the use of African worship style, and the use of traditional instruments has made it popular especially to those who do not fit in the mainline churches where these practices are forbidden. The bishop is their top leader followed by the padre, evangelists, and lay leaders.

<a name="akorinu"></a>**_Akorinu_ Movement**  

The _Akorinu_ movement, also known as watu wa mungu, was founded by Joseph Nga'ng'a of Kiambu District, during the colonial era of the late 1920s and early 1930s. The movement formed to protest against the colonizers who took the Kikuyu people's land. The colonizers also inflicted pain upon the Kikuyus through forced labor, the payment of taxes, and forcing them to abandon their cultural way of life.  

The _Akorinu_ Church claims to be guided by the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Elijah. It mainly bases its teaching on Acts 2:17, Joel 2:28, and Hebrews 8:1,10,13\. They hold to Agikuyu traditional practices like polygamy, circumcision, ritual uncleanness, and communication with ancestral spirits. They practice baptism by the Holy Spirit, and re-interpret the Bible to accommodate the African people's socio-religio-cultural practices. They pray facing Mt. Kenya and believe that God lives on Mt Kenya. The Akorinu Church has had an impact on Kenyan society because of their work ethic, humility, honesty, and a spirituality derived from the African religious worldview. It has given rise to various churches like the Holy Ghost Church of East Africa, God's Word Holy Ghost Church, Foundations of the Prophet Church, Chosen Church of Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit Church of Zion, African Holy Ghost Christian Church, and African Mission of the Holy Ghost Church of East Africa.

<a name="bibleway"></a>**The Bible Way Restoration Ministries**  

This charismatic church was started by Bishop Kinoga who was born, raised, and trained as a theologian in the Anglican Church of Kenya. After a period he declined to serve with the Anglican Church of Kenya but chose to work with Bishop Evans Mrima's church called the Gospel Outreach Ministries until Mrima died. Mrima's death caused division in the Gospel Outreach Ministries Church when the pastors failed to elect a bishop because each of them wanted to become bishop. At this point Kinoga started the Bible Way Restoration Ministries, thus named because after the bishop's death each of the pastors went and started a church and the former members were left in darkness and without a leader. According to Kinoga, the Bible Way Restoration Ministries provided restoration and a way for former members of the Gospel Outreach Ministries. The church encourages Bible reading among all members, the giving of tithes, the ministration of the Holy Spirit, praise and worship celebrations, the inclusion of African song and dance in the services, the gift of prophecy, healing, and baptism by immersion. The bishop is the highest leader followed by the pastors and church elders.

<a name="chrisco"></a>**Chrisco Fellowship Church**  

This church was started in 1978 by Apostle Harry Das who came to Nairobi for two weeks in 1977\. After these two weeks God called him to settle in Kenya and pray for this nation that was wracked by ethnic hatred, to teach Kenyans to reach spiritual maturity and help foster unity among pastors, church leaders, and believers who came his way. Das was introduced to Christianity by an elderly black woman when he was in his twenties. Dan and his wife Cora were both born and raised in Guyana, South America--Das of Indian descent and Cora of African descent. The two met when he was pastoring in Guyana and they married much later in the U.S.A., when he was 45 in 1972.*  

The name "Chrisco" stands for "Christ's co-workers' church." Initially the Chrisco Church started both a "morning glory" service when people could meet for prayers before their offices or work places opened and lunch hour services. These meetings were initially held at All Saints Cathedral, at Cameo Cinema on Kenyatta Avenue, and on the Kenyatta International Conference Centre (KICC) ground floor. The number of members meeting in these prayer fellowships increased and they converted the prayer meetings into the Chrisco Church.  

The Chrisco Church is founded on New Testament teachings especially the fivefold ministry gifts of apostleship, prophesy, teaching, evangelism, and pastoral ministries given by God to the church. The church has a following among working class people in big towns. Its unique method of evangelism makes it popular. Its radio and TV evangelism has made it known all over the country. The church also evangelizes through literature printed on its own printing press.

<a name="redeemed"></a>**The Redeemed Gospel Church**  

This charismatic church was started in 1974 in the Mathare slums in Nairobi by Bishop Arthur Kitonga who sought asylum from Uganda where he was serving as a pastor of the Anglican Church during the brutal regime of Idi Amin Dada. The same year his close friend Bishop Paul Mutua joined him and helped to start another branch in Machakos. Their preaching method targeted students in schools to teach them the faith so that they would share their faith after school. This preaching method helped to spread the RGC which is now established throughout Kenya and can currently be found in most of Africa. The RGC draws its teachings from the Bible and emphasizes the principle of _sola scriptura_ (the Bible as its own interpreter). It includes women in its ministries and has even ordained women as pastors. The RGC facilitated the ordination of Bishop Margaret Wanjiru of [Jesus Is Alive Ministries](#jiam) (JIAM).

<a name="rohomuyia"></a>**_Roho Muyia_ Church Movement**  

This charismatic Neo-Pentecostal movement was started in 1997 by Rev. Patrick Mulunga who was born and raised in the Catholic Church. He had been a faithful Catholic in his youth, serving as an altar boy during Mass. Before finishing secondary school, he joined bad company that corrupted his morals.

After several years in prison he became ill and claimed to have had a vision of starting a church and serving God. Mulunga moved to Mumias Town where he began the ministry. The church has attracted the youth in large numbers because of its programs that are dominated by loud music and relaxed rules that the youth can easily follow.

This church was started in Lugali District by John Wafula, a former pastor of the Pentecostal Church. Wafula defected from the Pentecostal Church, claiming that cultural practices like traditional marriage, initiation, and burial rites were insufficiently observed. The United Pentecostal Church observes all of the above and believes in healing through prayer. The United Pentecostal Church believes that salvation is only through confession of sins and not only through baptism. The church emphasizes Christian faithfulness and blessings through faithful tithing. The church has many followers, mainly in Lugali District, especially in the village where people are still practicing the traditional cultural practices which this church allows. The bishop is its highest leader followed by the pastors and administrators.
