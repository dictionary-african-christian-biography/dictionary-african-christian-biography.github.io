Simeon Lourdel was a Catholic missionary
pioneer in Uganda. Born in the Pas-de-Calais, France, he became
a White Father, being ordained in 1877. He was chosen for
the first caravan to East Africa led by [Leon
Livinhac](livinhac_auguste.html) and arrived in Buganda in February 1879. He soon
became the mission's principal spokesman, being a good linguist
with a manifest faith and an enthusiasm which quickly drew
many Baganda to him; he acquired the personal name of "Mapera"
(Mon père), bby which he is still remembered. In the tense
uncertain atmosphere of the Ganda court of King Mutesa and
his son Mwanga, Lourdel's quick spirit was frequently called
into action as when, at a moment of crisis in 1881, he offered
to walk through fire carrying the Gospels if a Muslim spokesman
would do the same with the Koran. The offer was not taken
up and an immediate threat to the Christian community was
averted. Lourdel baptized at least 15 of the martyrs killed
in King Mwanga's persecution of 1885 and 1886, including Joseph
[Mukasa Balikuddembe](balikudembe_.html) and [Andrew
Kaggwa](kaggwa_andrew.html) (all have since been canonized). Expelled from
Buganda in 1888 by the usurping Muslim king Kalema, he returned
after the Christian victory in 1889 but died shortly afterwards.
Buganda Catholicism considers him its true founding father.
