[TORO]

Gabulieri Kiza was baptized by the Rev. T. R. Buckley on  October 31, 1897.[1] In 1898 he was elected a member of the Kabarole Church  Council.[2] He was a *gombolola* chief in Kibale, but he temporarily gave  this up to go to Ankole as a church teacher.[3] He was found to be a much  better teacher than most of the Baganda being sent to Ankole at this time.[4]  On his return to Toro he continued to work as a *gombolola* chief, and  after a time was transferred to Burahya.[5] He and [Petero Tigwezire](tigwezire_petero_and_miriya_mutakyanga.html) at one time wanted to  be ordained but Blackledge would not accept them because they would not  entirely give up drinking.[6] He later became an over-strict disciplinarian,  and his children had to be taken into boarding school for their own  protection.[7] His wife, Loi, was also trained as a teacher, receiving her  letter in July 1903, after which she taught for two or three years at  Kabarole.[8]
