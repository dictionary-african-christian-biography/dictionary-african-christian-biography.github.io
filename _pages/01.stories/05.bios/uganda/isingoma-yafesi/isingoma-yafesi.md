[BUNYORO]

Yafesi Isingoma was born at  Kikinda about five miles from Hoima. When young he was taken from his home by  the *barusura* to be a servant to them, was captured by the Batoro on a  raid, and brought up in Kasagama&rsquo;s *kikaale*. Here he received Christian  instruction and was baptized. In 1901 he returned to Bunyoro as a teacher as he  wished to return to his own country. He was the first Christian teacher at  Kibingo where the work was difficult as the people did not understand what  &ldquo;reading&rdquo; was all about. At this time he was also reunited with his own family  and was able to influence many of them to become Christians. After working for  a few years he studied for his first letter under the Rev. A. Lloyd at Hoima in  1908, and did his second letter under the Rev. A. B. Fisher in 1911 and 1912.  Like most Anglican teachers he was posted to one place after another, but  several times his postings took him to Nyamirima, the headquarters of Jemusi  Miti the Muganda *saza* chief. When his health failed it was to Nyamirima  that he again returned to teach Miti&rsquo;s children. When he retired he persuaded  his son to buy land near the church at Kakindo. His first wife, Rebeka died in  1936, and he married again, Eseri Kaburaho, who outlived him by one year.  Throughout his life he was a strong supporter of the church and his home was  known as a happy and well-ordered Christian household.
