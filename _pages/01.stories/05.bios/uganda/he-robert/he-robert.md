Rev. Robert Pickering Ashe was of the Church Missionary Society. He was educated at Rossall School and St. John’s College, Cambridge. He was ordained deacon in 1880, priest in 1881, and was accepted by CMS in 1882. From 1882 to 1888 and 1891 to 1893 he worked at Natete, Rubaga, and Mengo. He returned to England and resigned from CMS in 1894. He made the first translation of the Book of Common Prayer into Luganda. He is best known for his two commentary accounts of the events in Uganda: Two Kings of Uganda (London 1890) and Chronicles of Uganda (London 1894). From 1894 to 1922 and 1924 to 1925 he was chaplain at Smyrna, Turkey. In 1927 at the time of the CMS Uganda Jubilee he revisited the country, and was present when Alexander Morehead Mackay’s body was exhumed at Usambiro and reburied at Namirembe.
