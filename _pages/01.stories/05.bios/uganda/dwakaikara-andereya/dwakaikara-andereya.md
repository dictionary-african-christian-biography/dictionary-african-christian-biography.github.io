[BUNYORO]

Rev. Andereya Dwakaikara was  born at Kisweka in Buyaga, and started to receive Christian instruction in  April 1899. He was written down as a catechumen in December 1899, and was  baptized by the Rev. [Nuwa  Nakiwafu](nakiwafu_nuwa.html) on April 22, 1900. In 1901 he was confirmed and started to  work as a church teacher under Kezekiah Kagwa and Eriya Balomezi at Kijamba.  Here he received no salary but was supplied with food and clothes by [Paulo Byabaowezi](byabaowezi_paulo_and_damari_karujuka.html) in  whose domain he was working. In June 1901 he was put in charge of a church in  Kihaguzi. He now received a small salary and lived with Byabaowezi&rsquo;s family. He  did not stay here long as in August of the same year he was sent to Bugoma  where he worked for a year. In July 1902 he went to Burega with Asanasio  Bafirahara (See Chapter III, section 5 [of Pirouet&rsquo;s thesis noted below]). In  January 1903 he had to return from there and for a year he worked at Hoima. In  1904 he started to read for his first letter which he got in 1905 just after  his marriage to Esiteri Kiiza. In 1906 he went to read for his second letter.  This he achieved in 1908 and for the next two years he worked in Duhaga&rsquo;s  palace at Hoima. In 1911 he went to Buganda to read for his third letter, but  because of the great need in Bunyoro he entered the deacon&rsquo;s course. He was  ordained deacon with [Erasito  Nyakana](nyakama_erasito.html) in May 1911 and returned to work at Hoima until his  ordination as priest in 1912. He spent the rest of his life at Masindi and Kiryandongo,  and retired in 1942.
