[ANKOLE]

Rev. Canon Yoeri Buningwire was a Muhima who in December  1899 was present at the interview between Bishop Tucker, Dr. Cook and the *mugabe*,  as a result of which teachers were finally able to enter the country. He also  remembers the previous two groups of teachers who had tried to stay in Ankole  but failed. He was baptized in 1903 and confirmed the following year. He was  one of the first group in Ankole to volunteer as teachers, and went to Ibanda  where he had to work under Muslim *saza* chief, Abdul Asiz Balwadde. He  succeeded in getting on with him and working together with him for the  suppression of witchcraft. He then taught in Kashari. He did some of his  training as a teacher at Kabarole where [Hana Kageye](kageye_hana.html) looked after him like a mother. In  1916 he was ordained deacon and in 1918 priest. He then worked at Ibanda for  two years, followed by two years at Kabale when that was first made a mission  station. Since then he has worked at Mbarara. In 1942 he was made a Canon of  Namirembe Cathedral.
