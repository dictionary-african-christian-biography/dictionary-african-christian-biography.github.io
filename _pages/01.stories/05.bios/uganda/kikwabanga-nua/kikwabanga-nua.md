Rev. Nua Kikwabanga was among the Protestant Christians exiled in Ankole in 1888. In 1889 he travelled to the Coast with H. M. Stanley. In 1890 he joined Bishop Alfred Robert Tucker’s party at Freretown, and on the way up to Uganda taught George Lawrence Pilkington Luganda. In 1894 when CMS work was restarted in Busoga, he and Yosua Kiwavu went to Iganga as evangelists. He was ordained deacon in 1896 and worked at Kaliro in Busoga; ordained priest 1899. During the Sudanese Mutiny of 1897 he saved the life of H. T. C. Weatherhead, hiding him in a swamp. From 1899-1903 he worked at Bukaleba, and was then transferred to Makerere. He died of sleeping sickness in 1905.
