Bishop John Henry Mary Biermans was of the Mill Hill Mission. He was  made priest in 1896 and left for Uganda in October of the same year. In 1897 he  was present at the proclamation of Daudi Chwa as *Kabaka* of Buganda.  Later in the same year he was sent to Fort Lugumba near Luba&rsquo;s in Busoga to  serve as Chaplain to the African forces during the Sudanese Mutiny. In 1898 he  was appointed tutor to the Catholic princes, Augustine and Joseph. In 1899 he  met Kabarega and Mwanga on their way into exile in the Seychelles. He founded  the Buvuma Island Mission in 1901. During Bishop Henry Hanlon&rsquo;s absence in England in 1904  to 1905 he was in charge of the Vicariate, and on Hanlon&rsquo;s return he was  appointed Superior of Nsambya Mission. In 1910 to 1911 he was on leave, and in  1912 he was consecrated Bishop of Gargara and succeeded Bishop Hanlon as Vicar  Apostolic of the Upper Nile. In 1914 he attended the 4th Chapter  General of St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foreign Missionary Society (The Mill Hill Mission). In  1924 he became the third Superior General of the Society. He retired in 1934.  At his silver jubilee as a priest he was described as &ldquo;the most popular man in  Uganda.&rdquo;
