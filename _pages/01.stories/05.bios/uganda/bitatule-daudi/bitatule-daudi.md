[BUNYORO]

Daudi Bitatule was the first person to be baptized at Hoima,  by the Rev. [Nuwa  Nakiwafu](nakiwafu_nuwa.html) on October 21, 1900, and his wife, Lydia, was baptized the  same day.[1] He became a sub-chief under [Paulo Byabaowezi](byabaowezi_paulo_and_damari_karujuka.html) at Bugoma, holding the  chieftaincy of [illegible]. Here he was well known by the Ladburys and a strong  supporter of the church.[2] He was involved in the uprising of 1907 against the  Baganda, and was taken off to Kampala in the chain-gang.[3] Within a year or so  he went as a teacher to south Lango where at first he found the work difficult  because he did not know the language.[4] Because he was literate, he eventually  found his way to a chieftaincy, via a clerkship, and finally became *saza* chief of Kyoga County.[5] He retired to Kigaya, where he died, and was buried  outside the church where his gravestone may be seen.
