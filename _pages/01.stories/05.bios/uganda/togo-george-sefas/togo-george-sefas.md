Sefas George Togo was baptized on May 10, 1903 at Mbarara,  and was first appointed as one of the soldiers who guarded the *Mugabe*.  He was then made market-master at Mbarara.[1] In 1908 he was appointed *saza* chief of Igara when Mukontani was murdered.[2] He was a good *saza* chief,  and built many churches and schools. He remained in this position until his  death in 1934.[3]
