[BUNYORO, Mugana]

Nasanieri Kyawola arrived in Bunyoro in September 1900 and  was first sent to Lukondwa near Masindi.[1] After a time he was transferred to  be head teacher at Masindi.[2] During the *Nyangire* rising he had all his  crops stolen because he was a Muganda.[3] There was no personal feeling against  him, however, and he was was well-liked and sociable. He remained at Masindi  until c. 1913, and his friendly relations with the Banyoro are shown by the  fact that after his return to Buganda he used to visit the people of Masindi  from time to time.[4] Walker described him as an outstandingly good teacher who  took a real missionary interest in his work.[5]
