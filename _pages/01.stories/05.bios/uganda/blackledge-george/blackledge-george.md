Ven. George Robert Blackledge was of the Church Missionary Society.  He was educated at Chorley Grammar School and trained as a mechanical engineer.  He was ordained deacon in 1894, priest in 1895, and arrived in Uganda the same year. From 1895-1905 he worked in Kyagwe, and from 1906-1910 at Kabarole, Toro.  He was at Kikise, Buddu from 1911-1914, when he became a temporary chaplain to  the forces until 1917. He was then appointed Rector and Canon Missioner of St.  Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral, Namirembe, and Sub-Dean in 1922. In 1926 he was appointed  Archdeacon of Uganda and was awarded the O.B.E. in 1928. He left Uganda in 1931  and from 1931-1934 was Vicar of Hernhill. He then retired to Worthing where he  died in 1945.
