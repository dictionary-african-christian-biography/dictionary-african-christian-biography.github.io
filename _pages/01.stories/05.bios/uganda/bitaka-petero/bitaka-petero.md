[BUNYORO]

Petero Bitaka was born in Bugangaizi but came to Lukondwa  near Masindi where he seems to have lived in the church *mailo*.[1] He was  the first Christian to be baptized in this place. He had been instructed for  baptism by [Nasanieri  Kyawola](kyawola_nasanieri Kyawola.html), and was baptized by the Rev. C. H. T. Ecob on March 24,  1902.[2] Soon afterwards he began to work as a church teacher, and in 1908 the  Rev. H. B. Ladbury met him at Kigumba, Kiryandongo, where he was then  teaching.[3] In February, 1910 he went to Acoli and Yonosani Balikata, but  Bitaka was the leader, and he stayed there for a year at a time when there were  no European missionaries at Acoli.[4] Later he trained and took one &ldquo;letter,&rdquo;  and went to Lango to teach for a period of about four years. He eventually  retired from teaching and returned to peasant farming, living near the church  in Hoima.[5]

**Notes**(short  form; see [List of  Sources](Pirouet_AppendixA_Sources.html) for complete citations):
1. Kyopaali and S. Kakumba, 1967; *Masindi Baptism Register* gives the name  of his chief as being his church teacher, hence it is likely that he was a  tenant on church *mailo*.

2. *Masindi  Baptism Register.*

3. *Ladbury  Journals*, February 3, 1908.

4. *Gulu  Service Book*.

5. S. Kakumba, 1967.

This biography, written by Louise Pirouet, was included in &ldquo;Appendix A: Biographical Notes,&rdquo;  on page 375 of &ldquo;The Expansion  of the Church of Uganda (N.A.C.) from Buganda into Northern and Western Uganda  between 1891 and 1914, with Special Reference to the work of African Teachers  and Evangelists&rdquo; (PhD Thesis: University of East Africa, 1968). Pirouet  published this thesis as *Black  Evangelists* (London: Rex Collings, 1978). However, *Black  Evangelists* does not reproduce the detailed biographies, complete with  references to sources, found in Appendix A of the thesis.
