[BUNYORO]

Mika Fataki was a Musoga whose  original name was Lubuale [ending partially illegible]. His father was a chief  in Busoga. During Mwanga&rsquo;s reign he took service in the *lubiri* as an *askari*.  In 1886 he fled to Ankole with the Christians although not yet a Christian  himself. He then went to Bunyoro and stayed there as a *murusura* under  Ewabudongo [beginning partially illegible] where he helped to guard the *kikaale* (royal enclosure). Here he earned the nickname Fataki by which he was always  afterwards known (Fataki is the Swahili for gun-cap and it is said he earned it  because of his good marksmanship).[1] In 1894 he went to Toro where he met Mako  Lweimbazi, a Muganda teacher, and he started to learn to read the *Watoka* [partially illegible]. From Toro he went to Buganda where he continued to learn  to read, and asked for teachers to be sent to Bunyoro. In 1895 he was  instrumental in getting the Rev. A. B. Fisher to visit Bunyoro, and in getting  Buganda teachers—he made several journeys to Nango for this purpose, as the  teachers, meeting opposition, did not stay long. He was baptized at Namirembe  by the Rev. H. W. D. Kitakule on July 24, 1898.[2] In 1889* he preached his  first sermon at Masindi.[3] In 1901 the missionaries were very pleased when he  was appointed s*ekibobo*, *saza* chief of Chope which included  Masindi.[4] He contributed two tusks of ivory for the building of the third  Namirembe Cathedral. In 1915 he retired to Kigaya and helped Paulo Mude to  establish the first church there. He did much to encourage agriculture, and his  wife helped to teach the women.[5] In 1931 he wrote and account of the coming  of Christianity to Bunyoro which was published in the *Bunyoro Church  Magazine*, 1932, pp. 65-7, 96.
