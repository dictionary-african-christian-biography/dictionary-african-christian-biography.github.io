[TESO,  Musoga]

Rev. Canon Petero Lukungu left his parents as a child to  help his father&rsquo;s blood brother with the cattle, and he eventually found  himself looking after the herds of the young chief Nadiope who was then away at  school. There he met Christians who encouraged him to read. For this he was  severely beaten by his master, but his master&rsquo;s mother nursed him until he  recovered, and reproved his master, for to treat a blood brother&rsquo;s child thus  was contrary to all acceptable behavior, and many of the family were becoming  Christians. Lukungu&rsquo;s determination to read led him to find his way to the Rev.  H. Mathers who found him lodging with a teacher called Zakaliya Kayeyera.  Whilst still a catechumen in 1906 he accompanied Mathers on a safari through  Bulamogi, his job being to carry the cinematograph. In April 1906 he was  baptized, and in 1907 he was confirmed, and accompanied Mathers as a teacher  when he went to open a mission at Kaliro. In 1911 just after his marriage he  and his wife went to Kere in Kumam where Kazana was then *saza* chief. In  1913 he got his first letter and was then sent to Serere, but Kazana asked for  him back again, and this was granted. In 1916 he got his second letter, and was  then sent to Kalaki in Kumam. In 1919 he qualified as a lay-reader, and was put  in charge of the church at Dokolo which he rebuilt in 1921. There he stayed for  four years, having mastered the language, and he returned again in 1926 after  being ordained deacon. Kalaki had by then been made a parish, and Lukungu  worked under the Rev. Sedulaka Mugandawasura. After two years as a curate he  was ordained priest in 1928 and he was sent as parish priest to Kitgum in  northern Acoli. This was so remote that his wife could not face the thought of  taking the children there to join him, and the pastoral safaris which he  undertook in the course of his work were immense. In 1932 he was relocated to  Soroti where his family were able to be with him, and here he remained until  1947. On his retirement he was presented with a Certificate of Honor from King  George VI. He had also been made a Canon of the Upper Nile Diocese. He died in  1967 near Kaliro in Busoga.
