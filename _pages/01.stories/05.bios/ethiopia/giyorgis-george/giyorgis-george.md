Giyorgis, or George, *Abun&auml;* (perhaps fl. late 11th and early 12th century A.D.), was a Metropolitan of Ethiopia appointed at the Emperor's request by Michael IV, Patriarch of Alexandria from 1092 to 1102. He caused offence by his "infamous affairs and vile deeds," which led to his arrest by the Emperor. He was sent back to Egypt and, at the Emperor's request, was imprisoned there for several years.
