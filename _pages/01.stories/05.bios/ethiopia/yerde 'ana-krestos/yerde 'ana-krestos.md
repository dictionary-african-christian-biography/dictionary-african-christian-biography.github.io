Yerde'An&auml;-Krestos was a native of Bugena who held the high office of abbot of the influential monastery of Däbrä Libanos of Šimäzana between 1225 and 1268 A.D., during the closing decades of the Zagwé dynasty. His name is found in several of the feudal charters granted to the monastery in this period. He bore the ascetic name of Säga-Mäta'e and held the title of *'aqabé sä'atä Mäta'e*. (*'aqabe sä'at* signifies literally "guardian of the hours" and was one of the highest ecclesiastical offices; Mäta'e is another name for *Abba* Libanos, founder of the monastery). In later years Yerde'anä-Krestos was accorded the designation of *bes'u*, 'blessed'.
