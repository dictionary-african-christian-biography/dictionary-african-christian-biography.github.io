Gersem, Emperor (perhaps fl. 8th century A.D.), was a ruler of the Aksumite Empire known only through his currency, which is found in gold and bronze. Apparently the last sovereign of Aksum to mint in gold, he is described in Greek on these coins as "King of the Aksumites," while the bronze coins call him *"negus"* in Ge'ez, and carry the device "You will conquer in Christ." All the currency bears his effigy and the Cross of Christ, but tends to be cruder than that of previous rulers, suggesting that the skill of minting was being lost. His reign may have been between those of Emperors Hataz I and Hataz II.
