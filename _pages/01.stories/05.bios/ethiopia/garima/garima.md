G&auml;rima, or Yeshaq, *Abba* (perhaps fl. late 5th and early 6th century A.D.), was one of the Nine Saints, Monophysite missionaries who came to Ethiopia at the turn of the fifth century. His Life is contained in a late fifteenth-century *gädl* (Acts) written from the standpoint of Endä Gärima in Tegré. He was the son of a certain Mäsfeyanos, King of Rome or Rum (Byzantium), and his wife, Sefengeya. His mother bore him through the intercession of the Virgin Mary after fifteen years of barrenness. He was sent to study theology at the age of twelve, but later, on his father's death, became king against his will. After he had ruled seven years, he was summoned by *Abba* Päntäléwon and, with the help of the Archangel Gäbre'él, was able to reach Aksum in three hours. There he joined Päntäléwon and remained with his community for five years until they parted company, when he went to Mädära and founded a monastery. He stayed there for seventeen or twenty-three years performing miracles, driving out demons, and tending to the sick. The Emperor Gäbrä-Mäsqäl is reputed to have built him a church there, which he endowed liberally. Gärima died on 17 *Säné* (24 June).

In the *Gädlä 'Arägawi*  the name Yeshaq is applied to Zä-Mika'él's father.
