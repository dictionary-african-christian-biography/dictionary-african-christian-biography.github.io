Anaeb or Ebana, Emperor, (perhaps fl. 6th or 7th century A. D.), was a Christian ruler of the Aksumite Empire in the period after Emperor Kaléb. He is known only through his currency, which was struck in silver, inscribed in Greek, and bears his effigy and the Cross. C. Conti Rossini suggests the reading ANAS for the name of this Emperor.
