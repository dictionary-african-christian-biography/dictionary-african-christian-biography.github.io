W'zb Emperor, was a son and one of the successors of Emperor Kaléb as ruler of the Aksumite Empire. It is not possible, at present, to place him in historical perspective in relation to the other sons of Kaléb, Bétä-'Esra'él and Gäbrä-Mäsqäl, who are also known from a Ge'ez inscription in South-Arabian script, found at Aksum, in which he records a war against a people called WYTL, not known elsewhere.

His title, as given in this inscription, is as follows: "W'zb, King of Aksum, of Himyar, of du-Raydan, of Saba', of Salhen, of Béga, Kasu, Siyamo, and of WYTL, *be'esi* HDFN, son of 'Ellä-'Asbeha servant of Christ."
