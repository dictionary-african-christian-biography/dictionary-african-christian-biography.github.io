Hir&ucirc;n, or Gabron (d. c. 1209 A.D.), was a brother of Empress Mäsqäl-Kebra, wife of Emperor Lalibäla, according to an Arabic source. Other readings of the name are Hetron, Hetrun, Gedron or Gedrun. *Abunä* Mika'él of Fua, Metropolitan of Ethiopia c. 1205-1209, fled back to Egypt to complain to John VI, Patriarch of Alexandria from 1189 to 1216, claiming that he had been forced to make Hir&ucirc;n a bishop, at the insistence of the Empress, and that Hir&ucirc;n had assumed many of the prerogatives of the Metropolitan and had also assaulted Mika'él and attacked his house while Lalibäla was campaigning elsewhere, and had caused Mika'él's flight. Inquiries conducted by the Patriarch's investigator, *Abba* Musa, revealed that the attacks on Mika'él were in fact made by the family of a church dignitary whom Mika'él had had killed on suspicion of theft and that Hir&ucirc;n had been remaining in seclusion in his own house, venturing out only on Sundays to go to church to say Mass; in any event, he had died soon after Mika'él left Ethiopia. Mika'él was deposed and banished.
