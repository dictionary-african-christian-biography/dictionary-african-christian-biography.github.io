Yohannes Mesraqawi, *Abba* (perhaps fl. 11th century A.D.), also known as Yohannes of S&auml;g&auml;ro from the monastery which he founded, was a monk and missionary of uncertain date. A foreigner "from the East," he was apparently active in northern Šäwa, and he is often called "The Apostle of Mänz." His unpublished *Life* contains few historical facts; extracts are translated by Cerulli.
