Michael I was a Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria who was imprisoned by the Muslim rulers of Egypt and is said to have been subsequently released through the intervention of an unspecified Emperor of Ethiopia. The story as recalled in the Ethiopian *Synaxarium* is that this Patriarch, who held office from 743 to 767, and is a saint of the Ethiopian Church, was imprisoned and subjected to indignities, whereupon the Emperor was "filled with holy indignation," and "went down to Egypt," where he "laid waste many cities." The King of Egypt then freed Michael, who wrote to the Emperor to that effect, whereupon the latter "returned to his country in peace."

Richard K. P. Pankhurst
