A Za&iuml;rean Catholic clergyman and a renowned advocate of the Africanisation of Christianity, he lived through the turbulent years preceding and following his country's independence.

He was born on 12 December 1917 in Kinshasa, then Leopoldville, to a mother from the Equateur Region and a Baluba father. He was educated at the Petit S&eacute;minaire in Bolongo and the Grand S&eacute;minaire in Kabwe where he studied the classics and humanities for eight years.

Malula started his clerical career as a priest in the parish of Christ-roi. As the first black parish priest in Kinshasa, he became dissatisfied with the paternalistic attitudes with which both the church and the Belgian colonial authorities treated Africans. In 1959, just a year before the independence of what was then called the Belgian Congo (renamed Za&iuml;re in October 1971), Malula became the auxiliary bishop of Kinshasa. He remained in that position until July 1964 when he was appointed archbishop of Kinshasa. He was made a cardinal in April 1969.

Cardinal Malula became especially renowned as a result of his efforts to indigenize the Catholic Church in Za&iuml;re and to help achieve its autonomy. He called for the Africanisation of the liturgy and for the use of valid elements in traditional religion by the church. With changes of this kind, he hoped Africans would be able to make the Catholic religion their own. Malula also became an advocate of the dignity of women, denouncing whatever turned them into a "slave or instrument of lust."  Moreover, he denounced tribalism as the curse of Africa. However, his pursuit of change and "authenticity"--as he described his call for Africanisation--did not include giving up Christian names and replacing them by African ones. So when President Mobutu launched his "Authenticity" campaign by changing the country's name to Za&iuml;re and his own from Joseph-D&eacute;sir&eacute; Mobutu to Mobutu Sese Seko, Malula led the church in criticizing the regime, for he saw this campaign as an extreme interpretation and its implementation as undemocratic. The Catholic Church was and still remains a very powerful force in Za&iuml;re with over 40 percent of the population as members.

Malula refused to obey the order that Za&iuml;rean citizens give up the use of Catholic Christian names. He also disagreed with proposals that the youth wing of the ruling Movement Populaire de la R&eacute;volution (MPR) should establish cells within all religious institutions throughout the country. The state took over all Catholic and other mission schools and banned religious instruction in schools, and although the schools were returned to church control later, religious instruction was not allowed and all Christian festivals ceased for years to be public holidays. Supporters of the regime reacted fiercely and there were threats to the churchman's life.

Malula's clashes with the Mobutu regime led to his exile to Rome for five months, from January to May 1972. The political bureau of the MPR accused the churchman of subversion, while the state press drummed up a campaign against "counter revolutionaries."  Malula was allowed to return to Za&iuml;re after he had virtually capitulated to the government on most of the policy measures in dispute. The papal visit to Za&iuml;re in May 1980, during which Cardinal Malula and President Mobutu met jointly with Pope John Paul II, was seen by some as an indication of the reconciliation between the state and the church.

After that, Malula had to deal with more problems from the Vatican. He would have liked to see married men ordained as priests, and, as this was not allowed, he encouraged the elderly natural leaders of the communities to become catechists. His great project, however, in the last decade of his life on which he spent a great deal of his time was to establish a "Council of the African Church" which would formally work through the problems of combining Africa and Christianity. It was his hope that such a council would eventually lead to the synthesis of the valuable elements of African traditional ways of life with Christianity, which has been seen as desirable since the Second Vatican Council.

Malula was awarded his country's highest honour, the Order of the Grand Leopard. He died on 12 July 1989 in a clinic in Brussels.
