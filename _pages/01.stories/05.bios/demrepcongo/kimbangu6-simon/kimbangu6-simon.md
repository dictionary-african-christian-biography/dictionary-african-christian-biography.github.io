Simon  Kimbangu is perhaps one of the most famous founders of an African initiated  church. The church body he found remains highly influential in the DRC,  counting over five million members. He began his ministry after a vision, which  led him to become an itinerate preacher and healer. His activities put him in conflict  with the authorities, who gave him a death sentence which was commuted to life  imprisonment. After his death in 1951, stories circulated about his  resurrection. Kimbangu was the founder of a truly indigenous African church,  which continues to address the spiritual needs of African people with a  creative theology.

**Family  and education background**

Though Simon  Kimbangu did not write much except for a few letters, literary sources about  his life and ministry are numerous. Son of Kuyela and Luezi, Kimbangu was born  most likely in September 1889 at Nkamba village (DRC), near the Ngombe-Lutete  Protestant Station of the Baptist Missionary Society (BMS). After the death of  his mother Luezi, Kimbangu grew up in the house of his aunt Kinzembo. He  attended the Baptist Mission School in Ngombe-Matadi. His early jobs ranged  from being a cook for the Baptist missionaries to working as a catechist in his  native village. He also did some casual work in Kinshasa and Matadi. He married  Marie Mwilu who gave birth to three children: Charles Kisolekele (1914),  Salomon Dialungana-Kiangani (1916) and Joseph Diangenda (1918).

**Leadership**

Simon  Kimbangu&rsquo;s leadership story started with the vision he had on March 18, 1921.  According to the testimony he entrusted to one of his friends, the vision  showed him a strange person bringing the Bible to him and asking him to read it  and preach. He was also told to go to a neighboring village to pray for a sick  child and heal him. Simon Kimbangu went to this village the next day, found the  child, prayed for him and the child was healed. After that, Simon Kimbangu began  to travel around the villages, preaching the Good News and healing the sick.  Yet, his divine mission is reported to have started especially on April 6, 1921,  which happened to be the 430th anniversary of the baptism of King  Afonso. The date also corresponds to the number of years that the Israelites  spent in slavery in Egypt. [1]

In May 1921,  about four thousand pilgrims rushed to Nkamba village. Consequently, Catholic  and Protestant catechism schools, hospitals and medical centres emptied  themselves, as well as local businesses. Under the instigation of the Redemptorist  Fathers, the colonial administration issued an arrest warrant against Simon  Kimbangu. He went underground while his movement developed in hostility to the  colonial power. Some days later, Simon Kimbangu was nevertheless arrested and  brought before a military council of war.

During a  public trial on October 3, 1921, he was condemned to death. The motives of his  condemnation read as follows: attacks perpetrated by his followers on the  administrator of Cataractes Division on May 11 and June 6, 1921; the rumours  about his healings and resurrections; the preaching of a new God far mightier  than the State; the announcement of a national and black church; and the breach  of national security. However, civil administration officers and Baptist  Missionaries managed to introduce a petition for a reprieve on behalf of Kimbangu,  which King Albert granted in November 1921. As a result, Simon Kimbangu&rsquo;s death  sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. He was put into jail in  Stanleyville (Kisangani) and then Elisabethville (Lubumbashi) where he died on  Friday, October 12, 1951, after thirty years of suffering. [2]

**Impact**

Simon  Kimbangu&rsquo;s disciples claimed that he was resurrected on Sunday, October 14,  1951. He was seen alive in places such as Lubumbashi, Kinshasa, and Lowa, to  name but a few. In 1956-57, his youngest son Joseph Diangenda gathered  different Kimbanguist sects and formed one church: The Church  of Jesus Christ on Earth by the Prophet Simon Kimbangu. [3]

Historically  speaking, the ministry of Simon Kimbangu consisted of preaching the Word of  God, and condemning witchcraft and polygamy. He healed some sick people through  prayer while his mother was known as a traditional healer who restored health  on the basis of medicinal plants. He announced an imminent coming of Christ who  would bring down the colonial powers. In the views of the most famous Congolese  historian Isadore Ndaywel, Simon Kimbangu&rsquo;s actions can be considered part of  the messianic creations and reactions of an oppressed people who, under severe  pressure, struggled for their survival. In any case, for Ndaywel, this is a  variant of a Christianity which the missionaries intended to be &ldquo;classic,&rdquo; but  which in practice had always conveyed an ambiguous code and language. The  Congolese prophet had his own vision of Christianity and enshrined his own  reading of the sacred message. [4] As a matter fact, MacGaffey described the  Kimbanguist Church as &ldquo;one of the world&rsquo;s best known religious movements&rdquo; and  &ldquo;the largest African-founded Protestant Church.&rdquo; [5] Since 1969, it has been a member  of the World Council of Churches. On the basis of a radically authentic view of  the Trinity, the Protestant Church in DRC ceased to recognise it as a Christian  church in 2002, whereas the Catholic Church in DRC suspended &ldquo;spiritual  ecumenism&rdquo; with it in 2004. The doctrinal teaching of the official Kimbanguist  Church holds that the persons of the Holy Trinity have metamorphosed and  incarnated themselves in the three sons of Simon Kimbangu: the Father as Charles  Kisolekele, Salomon Dialungana-Kiangani as the Son and Joseph Diangenda as the  Holy Spirit. One might agree that this reflects a radical inculturation or an extreme &ldquo;appropriation of a faith dogma in an African culture.&rdquo;  [6] Nonetheless, Kimbangu&rsquo;s legacy continues its historical trajectory through  the Church named after him the way it started with little or no support from  the Catholic Church or Protestant Churches.

Since  Mobutu&rsquo;s regime, the Congolese government remains the strongest ally of  Kimbangu&rsquo;s Church. Moreover, Kimbangu&rsquo;s followers honor the memory of their  spiritual father through constant Bible reading and local fundraising campaigns  for self-reliance in order to avoid financial dependence on Western donors.  They are also engaged in evangelizing Western countries. Indeed, the Bible is  the most precious legacy that Kimbangu left for his followers with the power to  interpret it in an extremely inculturated way that supports not only the  dignity of black people but also their supremacy over the whites. In other  words, Kimbangu&rsquo;s legacy led to an extremely inculturated church and an  extremely authentic church. Nonetheless, the stand of the Kimbanguist written  theology is noteworthy: &ldquo;The EJCSK believes in the Trinity, yet the Trinity is  symbolized by Simon Kimbangu&rsquo;s three sons, paths to the Trinitarian God.&rdquo; [7]
