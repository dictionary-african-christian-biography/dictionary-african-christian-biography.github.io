In 1955 he served as director of the first mission station of central Africa at Masisi, now known as East Za&iuml;re Field. In 1960 he became the furst African to serve as president of a field. In 1970 he became field secretary of the Trans-Africa Division and two years later was asked to be president of Za&iuml;re Union Mission. He held this office until 1980.

In 1973 Solusi Adventist College awarded him an honorary degree in theology. In 1983 he was decorated as the "Chevalier de l'Ordre National du L&eacute;opard," becoming the first Seventh-day Adventist to be honored by a civic medal in Za&iuml;re.
