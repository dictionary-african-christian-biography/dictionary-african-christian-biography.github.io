Paul Carlson was an American missionary medical doctor in the Belgian-Congo. Born in Culver City, California, Carlson did his medical studies at Stanford University. After a time in private practice he volunteered with his wife, Lois, for short-term medical ministry, which led to a career commitment beginning in 1963. He was assigned by the Evangelical Covenant Church to a mission station in Wasolo, a remote area of the Ubangi Province, where he worked in a primitive hospital serving some 200 patients a day. In 1964 this "forgotten corner of the Congo" was infiltrated by Simba rebel soldiers. He was taken captive and shot to death while trying to escape. Soon after his death the Paul Carlson Medical Foundation was established.
