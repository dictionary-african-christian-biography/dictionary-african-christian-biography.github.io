Jacques Désiré Laval was a French Catholic missionary to Mauritius.
He was born in Croth, near Evreux, France, was educated in
Paris, and became a medical doctor in 1830. A serious horse-riding
accident prompted his conversion in 1835, and he was ordained
to the priesthood in 1838. At Saint-Sulpice Seminary he became
a friend of [François
Libermann](../non%20africans/libermann_francois.html). After three years of parish work in France,
he was sent to Mauritius in 1841 for the evangelization of
the black slaves. He was the first missionary of the Congregation
of the Holy Heart of Mary, founded by Libermann, which merged
with the Congregation of the Holy Ghost in 1848. Laval succeeded
in organizing the religious life of the former slaves, emancipated
in 1835 but neglected by the white clergy. His missionary
method consisted in taking progressive steps, employing a
catechism in Creole adapted to illiterates, training of catechists
and women advisers (*conseilleuses*), providing intensive
pastoral care, setting up of a relief fund managed by the
Christians themselves, offering rural outreach by means of
chapels built by the faithful, and cooperating with other
missionary societies. The Roman Catholic Church in Mauritius
owes its renewal to Laval; thousands of pilgrims visit his
tomb each year on the day of his death, September 9.
