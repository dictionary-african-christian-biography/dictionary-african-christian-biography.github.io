Dawidi Manyango Kore was born in 1910, belonging to the Moru tribe, of the Garia Medewu clan. He spoke the Moru language, some English, and some Arabic languages. His father's name was Kore Warangwa Baya and his mother's Maniya Saliba.

He married Rebeka Kagwinya Gila and they had two children: one daughter, Damari Dawidi Manyango, and one son, Keliopa Ndarago Dawidi.

David Manyango began his education in 1919 at the CMS Elementary Vernacular School started by the Irish missionary doctor Fraser in Lui. He graduated in 1921 and went on to the CMS Intermediate school (Nugent School), which started in Juba and later moved to Loka (some seventy miles west of Juba) in 1922. He graduated with an intermediate school certificate in 1925.

After finishing his studies in Loka, David returned to Lui where he began working at the newly established CMS Mission Hospital in Lui as a nurse. After training in the same hospital, he worked there from 1927 until his death in 1990.

David helped implement the triple ministry of Dr. Frazer: teaching (in Lui Elementary School), healing (in Lui Hospital during week days), and preaching (in the Lui Parish chapel on Sundays).
David's Christian living encouraged many other people to join the church and follow Christ and to love one another.

He will be remembered for his contribution to Moru liturgy. Two hymns he wrote, number 58 and 63, are in the Moru hymn book.
