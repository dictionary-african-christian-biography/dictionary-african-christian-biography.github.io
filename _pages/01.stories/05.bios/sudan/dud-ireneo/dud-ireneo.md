A Jo-Luo (Jur), born at Mbili about 1912, son of chief Dud Akot and his second wife Akumo, Ireneo Wien Dud was baptized at Mbili in 1923. He entered Bussere Seminary (among the first) in 1933 and Gulu Seminary in 1940. After four years he was ordained a priest by Bishop R. Orler on December 21, 1944. He was subsequently in Wau, Kpaile, Raffili, Mbili, Tonj, and Warap. He spoke fluently Jur, Dinka, Belanda Bor and Bviri, English, Arabic, and Italian. When Rumbek Vicariate was created on July 3, 1955, he was appointed first bishop and consecrated in Wau cathedral on November 20, 1955. In 1960 he was transferred for health reasons and went back to Wau, where he died on April 24, 1988. A short biography was written by Mr. Louis Umodo.
