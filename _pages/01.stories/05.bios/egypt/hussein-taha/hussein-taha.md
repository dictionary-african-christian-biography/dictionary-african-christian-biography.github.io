**Love at first hearing**

Suzanne Brisseau, a young French Catholic lady whose  studies to be a teacher had been interrupted by the bombing of Paris in the  First World War, found work where her family took refuge in Montpellier,  reading for a blind graduate student. Taha Hussein, the blind Muslim student  from Egypt, was quite a phenomenon. Within five years, [he] had won a  bachelor's degree and a higher diploma (on Tacitus), passed the highly  competitive aggregation examination for university teachers and been awarded a  doctorate for his work on the fourteenth-century Arab historian Ibn Khaldun. He had mastered Greek and Latin. [1]

Taha, who called her his &ldquo;sweet voice,&rdquo; had an  uncanny intuition at their first meeting that she would be the woman of his  life, and indeed, some time afterwards, they both thought of marriage. Suzanne,  however, had to overcome the adamant opposition of her family when the subject  of marriage came up. &ldquo;What! A poor foreigner, a Muslim, and a blind one to  boot! You&rsquo;ve got to be crazy!&rdquo; they said  to her. But after her priest-uncle interviewed Taha, said he was a genius and  gave his support to their plans, they were able to marry with the blessing of  her family.

Suzanne  was to be not only his wife, and the mother of their two children, she was also  his life-long mentor and dearest friend, bringing him happiness and the  contacts which his blindness deprived him of. They shared during nearly sixty years  a passion for the truth, for freedom, for human dignity, and for God.

**Who was this man who so  captivated Suzanne&rsquo;s heart?**[2]

Taha  Hussein was born seventh of thirteen children in a poor Muslim family in Upper  Egypt. He became blind at the age of  three, due to incompetent treatment of an eye infection by an unskilled  practitioner. Taha took from the experience a profound aversion to ignorance,  and an immense respect for science and culture. As in all traditional families  of his epoch, he began his education in the Qur&rsquo;anic school (kottab) where he  learned the Qur&rsquo;an and its melodic recitation by heart. His intelligence was  such that he also memorized the *Alfiyyah* (medieval treatise on Arabic grammar). Singled out by his teachers, he pursued  his education at the prestigious El-Azhar University in Cairo.

He  spent eight years there and was trained in the traditional culture. But very  soon he rebelled in the face of what [in his memoirs] he called &ldquo;a leaden  atmosphere of outdated discourse.&rdquo; That earned him frequent tussles with the *oulemas* (learned religious authorities)  of El-Azhar, to the point of his being denied the doctorate by the university.  He transferred to the Free University of Cairo, founded in 1908, which he  entered with enthusiasm, but even there his Voltaire-like spirit brought him  into new conflicts. The University of Cairo was, however, a true place of  culture, where Egyptian and foreign professors offered a high quality education.  He would later write that from the day he entered the University of Cairo, the  doors of knowledge were opened wide for him. Taha Hussein received his  doctorate there&ndash;the first one awarded by the University&ndash;on Abu-Alala&rsquo; Al-Maari,  a blind skeptic philosopher of the 11th century with whom Taha Hussein  identified. Subsequently, he had his first forays into the world of Arabic  literature, which earned him the opportunity of receiving a government bursary  to continue graduate studies in France, where he disembarked in Montpellier  shortly after the outbreak of World War I, in November of 1914.

**Studies in France, and  marriage**[3]

During  four years in France Taha embarked upon a veritable interior (trans-cultural)  journey: he prepared and achieved a  license in Classic Literature (Latin &amp; Greek), a post-graduate diploma in  history, and a doctorate at the Sorbonne under Emile Durkheim on the famous  Muslim historian considered the Father of Sociology, Ibn Khaldun  (1332-1406). He also met the woman of  his life, a Catholic French woman, Suzanne Brisseau, during his first period of  study at the University of Montpellier. Their son, Moenis, reminisced with a  journalist some years ago about his parent&rsquo;s meeting and marriage:

> It was in Montpellier during the  First World War that Taha Hussein met Suzanne Brisseau, whose family had moved  there from Paris to escape the bombing. Suzanne  had been preparing to take the entrance exam for the prestigious &Eacute;cole Normale  Sup&eacute;rieure de Jeunes Filles, then located in the Paris suburb of S&egrave;vres, but  had had to interrupt her studies when the family moved to Montpellier.
> 
> 
> 
> Since my father was  blind, he needed someone to help him with his  French and to read to him. So he put an  advertisement in a local paper. Suzanne  applied for the job. However, she did  more than read to him. She accompanied  him to his lectures at the Montpellier Arts Faculty, and later, when they were  both in Paris she would walk hand in hand with him from his lodgings to the  Sorbonne.

He  called her his &ldquo;sweet voice&rdquo; because of the quality of her reading to him as he  was perfecting his French, since not all of the references for his study were  available in Braille. He stated in his  *Book of Days* (autobiographical memoirs) that since he first heard that &ldquo;sweet  voice,&rdquo; anguish had never entered his heart. [4]

They were married on August 2, 1917  and two years  after their marriage, upon completion of his doctoral studies, the couple moved  to Egypt (1919), which was to be ever afterward her adopted country. They would  go to Europe periodically for visits or vacations, but their life was in Egypt. (Even during her fifteen years as a widow,  Suzanne remained in Cairo until her death.) Their home in Cairo was frequented  by illustrious visitors of Catholic, Coptic, Protestant, and Muslim faiths, clerics,  philosophers, and atheists; musicians, educators, journalists, government  ministers, archaeologists, literary figures... Those who participated in the soir&eacute;es  unanimously praised the couple that welcomed them and offered such stimulating  company.

**Active professional life  during more than forty years**[5]

Upon  returning to Egypt with his wife, Taha held a series of university posts: professor,  Dean of the Faculty of Literature, founding Rector of the University of  Alexandria, and even Minister of National Education, but without ever bowing  before the administrative or political &ldquo;powers that be,&rdquo; nor ever renouncing  his work as literary critic and writer. His memoirs, *The Book of Days*, [6]  was a worldwide bestseller, and his Arabic translations of Gide, Sophocles, and  Racine show the breadth and depth of his culture and his openness of  spirit. His entire life was an  unremitting battle against the darkness and a constant struggle for the  dialogue of cultures and civilizations.

When  Fr. George Anawati, Egyptian Dominican scholar educated in Egypt, Lebanon,  France, and Algeria, first read in his mid-thirties Taha Hussein&rsquo;s book (in  Arabic) entitled *The Future of Culture in  Egypt *[7] he wrote in his diary: &ldquo;Egypt is at the crossroads of two civilizations: that is what makes possible the  reconciliation of the Christian culture and the Islamic culture.&rdquo; [8] Were not  perhaps Suzanne and Taha Hussein themselves  a Christian-Islamic couple living in deep mutual respect for their separate  religions over the course of more than fifty years, a &ldquo;place of encounter&hellip;  permitting the reconciliation of two cultures&rdquo; and two religions in their  extraordinarily close-knit conjugal life and their extraordinarily welcoming  home?

**Inter-faith marriage**

Suzanne  commented in her memoirs, written in 1974, less than a year after Taha&rsquo;s  death:
> June 3rd: Yesterday was Pentecost: once more I cherish the crystal clear memory  of a Pentecost in Gardone. I listened to  Mass in the upper Church. The old priest  had read the Gospel of John. The morning  was splendid, everything was fresh and beautiful, the sky, the lake, the trees,  the flowers. Everything was dazzling,  and I came down to the hotel repeating to myself: &ldquo;I leave you peace, I give  you peace.&quot; And I told you of these  words with great feeling.
> 
> As I remember that morning  today, I dream of that mysterious pact which has always united us in the  respect of our different religions.  Certain people are amazed at it.  Others understand that I can say my Rosary while you listened to the  Qur&rsquo;an in the next room. I still  sometimes turn on the radio to hear some verses of the Qur&rsquo;an as I begin my  Rosary, and at any rate, I understand interiorly.
> 
> You often spoke to me of the  Qur&rsquo;an, you would translate for me the verses that you specially loved, you  read the Bible, and I spoke of Jesus.  You often repeated, on many occasions:  &ldquo;One can&rsquo;t fool God.&rdquo; St. Paul  said as much. Certainly, one cannot  fool God. [9]
> 

Suzanne wrote of a visit they once made to Jerusalem,  and in a single sentence summarizes their rich experience of an interfaith  marriage: &ldquo;we each prayed according to our heart: in the mosque of Omar and in  Gethsemani.&rdquo;

**Family and Professional  Trials**

After  the birth of their second child, in the precariousness of their economic  situation, mother and children were obliged to take three months repose in  France (for the health of both mother and children), which was extremely  difficult for both of the spouses. Suzanne wrote, &ldquo;During three months we wrote  each other every day. His letters spoke  of his pain at my absence, but also of his courage and passionate love for his  country, his projects, his dreams, and the events which he narrated to me with  irony, humor or vehemence.&rdquo; [10]

She  cited several passages from her husband&rsquo;s letters which testified to the  intensity, vehemence and impetuosity of his love, as well as to the violence of  his character:

> I would like to tell you my  distress when I left the ship and returned to Cairo, when I immediately  returned to the house and went to our bedroom, and I kissed the rose, and  covered with kisses the photo which I cannot see&hellip;
> 
> 
> 
> It is impossible for me to  think of anything other than of you. I  cannot help crying each time I go into the bedroom; I find you everywhere there without finding you  anywhere&hellip; The rose has already wilted&hellip;
> 
> 
> 
> I&rsquo;d say that I&rsquo;m in Cairo for  nothing. I&rsquo;m in the process of wasting  three months of my life. Working? But what&rsquo;s the good of working without your  voice which encourages and counsels me, without your presence which guides  me? In whom can I confide freely? You&rsquo;ll tell me: &lsquo;you must write me&rsquo;. But you know well that writing is not like  speaking, and that reading a letter is not hearing one&rsquo;s voice. And you know well, that many times I don&rsquo;t  say anything, I just take your hand, I put my head on your shoulder&hellip; Three months, three months, it&rsquo;s horrifying,  I woke up into a terrifying blackness; I had to write you in order for that to  begin to dissipate. You see, absent or  present, you are always my light. [11]
> 

On  a certain occasion while Suzanne was still in France, Taha told her of a spicy  interchange which he had with several sheiks and ministers on the subject of  mixed marriages:

> &ldquo;Doctor Taha, are you  married?&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;Yes, of course, sir.&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;Would you bring your wife to  the meeting [a homage to another sheikh]?&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;Well, no, sir, because she is  in France.&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;In France? And you let her travel there all alone?&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;Well yes, sir; she&rsquo;s a French  woman.&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;And why then did you marry a  French woman? If I were free I would pass a law exiling every Egyptian who  married a foreign woman.&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;Please, sir, pass that law  right away; I&rsquo;m tired of hearing such discourse and would just as soon be out  of here.&rdquo;
> 
> The gentleman  broke out laughing, and everyone joined in, at my expense. The sheikh  Bekhit spoke again:
> 
> &ldquo;All the same, Doctor Taha,  I&rsquo;d like to understand the serious reasons which led you to marry a foreigner. You  are a good Egyptian, a good patriot, very intelligent; how in the world could  you do such a thing?&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;I met a young woman, and I  loved her; I married her. If I hadn&rsquo;t done it, I&rsquo;d have remained a bachelor, or  I would have hypocritically married an Egyptian woman whom I would have made  miserable because I loved another woman.&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t fathom that!&rdquo;
> 
> &ldquo;That you will never be able  to fathom, your Excellence; we will never understand things in the same manner&hellip;&rdquo;
> 

Suzanne remarked: "I knew the impulsiveness of  his indignation and the violence of his intentions&hellip; I tried to soften a bit his reactions. He would show himself full of good will: 'I  will obey you, I&rsquo;ll be honest in my articles, I won&rsquo;t cause trouble, my angel;  be tranquil. As long as you are at my  side, I won&rsquo;t be provocative; but, for example, I will be aggressive,  implacable in arguments.' And, there it is! He was right!&quot; [12]

Upon  Suzanne and the children&rsquo;s return to Cairo, their home once again became the  meeting place of many intellectuals and people of note in Egyptian  society:

> Upon  the creation of the State University in 1925&hellip; we began to have the Sunday meetings,  which grew considerably in Zamalek. Taha was a magnet drawing people together. The  foreign professors who constituted the first team had barely arrived, and they  naturally came to spend a few hours with us, along with their wives.&quot; [She  mentions the dean, a philosopher, an archaeologist, a poet and professor of  literature.]
> 
> Egypt  was moving painfully toward true independence. All the events, all the  surprises found echo with us, such that some visitors were astonished. Taha  shook, became indignant, protested, adjured, taught. Since he had none of the  dryness of the theorists and politicians, he was bowled over, even though he  realized things were inevitable&hellip;
> 

She  related the terrible things he suffered from the Muslim authorities when his  book on Pre-Islamic poetry was banned by el-Azhar University [1926], considered  dangerous and unacceptable because of its questioning of the traditional  authority given the Qur&rsquo;an and of its traditional interpretations in favor of  his own rationalistic explanations of its sense, based upon his critical study  of pre-Islamic Arabic literature. He was astounded, saddened, disappointed at  the reactions, at the hate messages, at the ostracism he experienced, that  reached the point of needing an armed guard outside the house. Still, he  withstood it all with his head high&hellip; After the worst had passed, Suzanne took  him to a village in Haute Savoie (France) to recover from his bitterness and  mend his damaged health. There, in nine days, he wrote the manuscript of the  first part of his life story, *Al-Ayyam* (&ldquo;Le Livre des Jours&rdquo;). [13]

In  1932, because of his staunch opposition to the politicization of honorary  degrees at the University at which he taught, he was eventually fired from the  University and found himself jobless &ldquo;paying dearly for the crime of being a  free man,&rdquo; commented Suzanne.

> But this time, they really  wanted to destroy him psychologically.  In addition to firing him from a faculty where he was the honor and  pride, they even wanted to burn his books. They took back the house he lived  in, covered him with insults, they tried to take from him every means of  support, by impeding the sale of the journal he published, and warning all  foreign delegations that they must abstain from offering him any work. I must  here offer homage to the American University of Cairo, which took up the  challenge, and asked Taha for a series of conferences which, beyond a small  material support, gave him the invaluable support of a young public which took  his side. [14]
> 
> That lasted nearly three years,  until the end of 1934. And it turned very quickly really bad. Claude, who had  had pneumonia, was barely out of danger, when Taha took to bed with the same  disease, very serious at a time when there were no antibiotics and when it was  a man already sorely tried who succumbed. There were no certain remedies: one  could only keep watch, attend to him, wait&hellip; and pray. In his deliriums Taha battled  with all his adversaries; he fought all night long, and fell on his pillow,  exhausted. Could I ever forget the dedication of Doctor Sami Kamal, his  presence and his affection which came to give me courage? Farid spent several nights at the house; I  don&rsquo;t know how I managed to stay on my feet for 11 nights, I who have always needed a lot of sleep. Finally Taha  recovered, and I&rsquo;d prefer only to think of that. [15]
> 
> &ldquo;One doesn&rsquo;t live in order to  be happy.&rdquo; When you said those words to me, back in 1934, I was wordless. Now I  understand. I know that when one is  Taha, one does not live in order to be happy; one lives to accomplish what God  asks of you. We were at the edge of despair, and I thought: &ldquo;No, not to be  happy, not even to make others happy.&rdquo; I was wrong. You gave joy, you inspired  courage, faith, hope which were in you. But this happiness which you knew well  was not of earth, and which, deep down, in the austerity of great souls, you  did not seek, am I prohibited from hoping that it is now given to you? [16]

Finally,  after several more months of a very precarious economic situation, Taha was  restored to his university post in December 1934, and things looked up, and in  1936 he recovered his position as Dean of the Faculty of Letters. Re-elected  Dean in 1939, the minister refused to approve the choice, and he was obliged to  resign as Dean, maintaining however his professorship at the University. He had  a series of other high government posts until his retirement in 1944. Yet again  in 1950 he was named Minister of Public Education, a post he held until January  1952, after the burning of Cairo. [17]

**Wide circle of friends**

They  moved to a house in Zamalek [1935?], and continued to host lively gatherings of  the most diverse people, friends new and old&hellip;  Suzanne wrote: &ldquo;It would be impossible for  me to name all those who passed through this house of Zamalek: writers, journalists, musicians,  archeologists, diplomats, theatre people, painters, doctors&hellip; sheiks talked  amicably with our Dominican friends, with the Rector of Holy Family  College&hellip; Massignon never failed to come  to the house, whether on Sunday or not, when he was passing through Cairo&hellip;&rdquo; [18]

J.  J. Perenn&egrave;s noted that,
> When a visitor of note came to our priory in  Abassiah (Cairo), we very readily paid a visit to the Taha Hussein home,  who had become an ally over the years.  He himself frequented the Dominican priory, [19] where there were  similar gatherings of notable researchers, thinkers, and political, scientific,  religious, and literary figures. Every year he would come to the Dominican  priory to request a Mass for the deceased members of his wife&rsquo;s family, and  would attend the Mass on the respective date. [20].

Later  they moved to Ramatan, in Guizeh, but in whatever house, their home was open to  a wide variety of seminal thinkers, people of letters and the arts, diplomats,  those committed to religious, social, and political change, Muslims and  Christians, clergy and secularized / atheist thinkers as well.

Taha  Hussein often traveled abroad in order to represent Egypt in numerous  congresses or to receive honors given by diverse universities and foreign  governments. Madame Taha Hussein accompanied her husband on these trips and   left  very vivid descriptions and anecdotes from many of the encounters on  those trips. Taha Hussein received honorary doctorates in Lyons (1930),  Montpellier (1946), Rome (1950), Oxford, and Madrid. In November of 1950, he  was invited to inaugurate the Institute of Islamic Studies in Spain. Everywhere  they would go, her husband represented the Arab culture in the West, as he had  done similarly in Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, and Saudi Arabia. [21]

**Children**

Their son Moenis described their family life: &quot;At home we always spoke  French. My mother never really learned Arabic. She spoke it sufficiently well  to go shopping and to handle the situations of everyday life. I think my father  was happy to speak French at home. He wrote articles and lectures in French,  but less from personal inclination than in response to requests. Arabic was the  language in which he thought and felt. It was only later that he transferred  his ideas and feelings into other languages.&quot; [22]****

Taha Hussein and Suzanne&rsquo;s children, their  daughter Amina and her younger brother Moenis, both were important figures in  Egypt. Amina, who died at the age of seventy, was among the first Egyptian  women to graduate from Cairo University. She and her brother, Moenis,  translated his *Adib* (&quot;The Intellectual&quot;) into French. This was especially  important to their father, who was an Egyptian who moved to France and learned  the language. Even more importantly, the character of *Adib* is one of a young  man who, like Taha Hussein, had to go experience the cultural shock of an  Egyptian studying and living in France.  [23]

During  many of the last years of his life, Taha Hussein liked to spend his summers in  Italy with his wife, beside the lac de Garde [Gardone]. [24]

**Taha&rsquo;s death**

The  following texts are taken from Suzanne&rsquo;s description of his last hours in Villa  Ramatan, in Guizeh, a suburb of Cairo [25]:

> The day before he died he had  a crisis which had already passed by the time his doctor arrived. His doctor read to him the news of his being  awarded the UN Human Rights award, and that they awaited him in New York on  Dec. 10th. &ldquo;The doctor read  it to him, and congratulated him warmly;  his only response was a wave of the hand which I knew so well, which  seemed to say: &lsquo;What does it matter?&rsquo; and which expressed his disdain, not of  homages, but of honors and decorations.&rdquo;
> 
> After giving him a shot, and  some light tranquilizers for the night, the doctor left, assuring her that the  patient would repose well. Somewhat  later his secretary and the housekeepers left as well, leaving her alone with  him.
> 
> 
> 
> In the course of the night at  one point he said to her &ldquo;They want to do me in; there are evil people.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who wants to do you in, my dear? Who is evil?&rdquo; &ldquo;Everyone!&rdquo; &ldquo;Even me?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, not  you.&rdquo; Then, with the bitter irony that marked certain of his moods, &ldquo;But, what  stupidity! Do they want to put a blind man at the helm of a ship?&rdquo; She  comments: at that point, he was  certainly remembering, dreaming of the obstacles which he&rsquo;d faced, the refusals  by which he had been countered, the sarcasm, even the insults&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t continue; he just said to me, as so  many times: &ldquo;Give me your hand&rdquo;, and he kissed it. The next morning he awoke extremely weak, and  Suzanne was, by her own admission &ldquo;bludgeoned by fatigue, in a senseless daze,  but strangely calm.&rdquo; &ldquo;I sat down next to  him. We were together, alone, incredibly close.  I didn&rsquo;t cry; the tears came later. Nobody else knew anything [about his  impending death] yet. We belonged to each other, unknown and solitary, just  like at the beginning of our journey together. In this last union, this supreme  intimacy, I spoke to him as I caressed that forehead which I so loved, that  noble, beautiful forehead in which neither age nor suffering had managed to  etch a single wrinkle, which no difficulty had succeeded in darkening and which  still irradiated its light &ndash; &ldquo;my love, my dear love.&rdquo; And I continued all  morning long, even when we were no longer alone, to say and say again, &ldquo;My  love&rdquo; because, before all else, and after everything else, and above all else,  he was my best friend, and in the meaning which I give to that word, my only  friend.&rdquo;
> 

Georges  Anawati wrote in homage concerning the day of his death [October 28, 1973] and  gave an exceptional witness to the conjugal relationship of his spouse:

> The peace of death  illuminated his face with vivid expression; I was privileged to be able, barely  an hour after his death, to bow down respectfully before him who had been,  during more than a half century, the uncontested master of Arabic literature.  In front of him was his admirable spouse, made still greater by the unexpected  blow that felled this great oak, destined &ndash;it would seem&ndash; to defy time. Thus, until the very last minute, she was at  his side, she who was the light of his intelligence and of his heart, she who  has sustained, with the soft tenacity of her invincible fidelity and  tenderness, the unconquered fighter who was Dr. Taha Hussein. [26]

In  her memoirs, at one point Suzanne Taha Hussein addressed to her husband the  same words he had written her in a note fifty-four years before: "Stay,  don&rsquo;t go away; whether I go out or whether I don&rsquo;t, I carry you with me. I love  you: stay, stay; I love you. I won&rsquo;t say 'good-bye,' because you are mine, you  are mine forever. Stay, my love." [27]

Just a year or so after his death, at the insistence  of friends, the octagenarian Suzanne undertook to write her memoirs of the  nearly sixty years shared with her husband Taha Hussein. She remained in Cairo until her death in 1989  at the age of ninety-four. Her memoirs, entitled *Avec Toi* [With You], are an  extraordinary personal, cultural, and spiritual chronicle. Written in French  and translated into and published in Arabic by the author&rsquo;s intention, the book  was never published in French until Dec. 2011 [Editions du Cerf, 384pp], thanks  to the intervention of a historian of blindness, who considered the work an  outstanding homage to a sightless man of great worth, as well as a testimony to  a great woman and their intercultural marriage.

In a continent so divided between Muslims and  Christians, the inter-faith (and inter-cultural) marriage of Taha Hussein and  Suzanne [Brisseau] Taha Hussein is patent evidence that there can indeed be  understanding, love, and mutual acceptance between adherents of these two great  world religions--in Africa.

Lach&egrave;se describes the memoirs of  Suzanne Taha Hussein in offering an extensive preview in French: &quot;The narrative  is presented as a one-sided conversation. Mme Taha speaks to her husband as  present, and in speaking to him, recalls their life together: personal memories which help us immensely,  those of us who didn&rsquo;t know Dr. Taha, to discover the riches of a personality  of which his literary works could never reveal all of his secrets.&quot; [p. 11] See  S.
