They both taught at Shinyanga and Mwenge secondary schools in Tanzania. While earning her master's degree at the University of Dar es Salaam, she lectured at Chang'ombe College of National Education. She became director of the Responsible Parenthood Project, sponsored by the Christian Council of Tanzania, and was concerned with troubled youth.
