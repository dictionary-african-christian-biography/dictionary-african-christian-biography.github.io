John Cupidon was one of the  first indigenous agents of the Methodist Church in The Gambia. Between 1822 and  1848 he served the emerging church as a translator, local preacher, catechist, teacher  and assistant missionary.

Archival material indicates  that John Cupidon was a Wolof slave from Goree Island, born, it seems, to enslaved  parents. Cupidon therefore grew up in a Eurafrican world, where European  traders, *signoras*, their Eurafrican  descent, their African partners and their African slaves intermingled. His African  name is unknown as is his date of birth. He was named Cupidon in Goree; the  name John, it seems, was given to him by the Methodist missionary John Morgan  at baptism.[1] In his reminiscences of work on the Gambia river, missionary  William Moister relates that in his childhood years Cupidon once accompanied  his British master on a trip to England; the journey had made an indelible  impression on him.[2] When his proprietor retired to London, Cupidon - still a  youth - was left behind in Goree in the care of the British merchant Charles  Grant. When Grant and his Eurafrican family, like most British citizens, moved to  Bathurst after Goree Island was returned to France in 1815, Bathurst also  became Cupidon&rdquo;s new place of residence.[3]

Charles Grant and his cousin  and founder of the Bathurst settlement Captain Alexander Grant were strong  supporters of Methodism. When the first Methodist missionary John Morgan  arrived in Bathurst, he stayed with Grant for some time; Alexander Grant  facilitated the Methodist settlement at MacCarthy Island. Because Grant and his  family fellowshipped with the Methodists, Cupidon also visited Methodist  gatherings.[4]

In 1822 Cupidon had a  conversion experience. Morgan gives a detailed account of this event in his  diary.[5] The new convert proved to be of great value to the nascent Methodist  community. Morgan wrote: &ldquo;In this Joloof was found the long wanted and much  desired convert, to be an interpreter to the Joloofs, of which a large part of  the population consisted, though but few of them knew the Negro English, in  which alone, until then, the Gospel had been there preached.&rdquo;[6] Cupidon proved  quite willing to take on the task of interpreter. Fluent in his native Wolof as  well as conversant with &ldquo;a little broken English,&rdquo; he became &ldquo;an efficient  translator and a valuable assistant in the Mission.&rdquo;[7] Morgan describes how he  and Cupidon preached in open air gatherings, sitting back to back, with Morgan  facing the English-speaking congregation and Cupidon facing the Wolof present and  Cupidon &ldquo;energetically enforcing what he said by stamping his foot and other  gestures which indicated the interest he felt in the good work.&rdquo; Before long, Cupidon  was able to preach independently.[8]

Cupidon had received no formal  education but proved eager to improve and quick to grasp what he was taught. He  attended the literacy classes of the Methodist evening school and it seems that  Grant also made a personal effort to enhance Cupidon&rdquo;s reading and writings  skills. Grant had apprenticed Cupidon to a carpenter but later employed him as  a storekeeper. With the aid of Grant, Cupidon was able to save enough money to  ransom himself. The exact date of his emancipation in uncertain, but it seems  that in March 1825, when Morgan left the Gambia and offered Cupidon some  compensation for his voluntary assistance, he was already in a position to  decline the offer of money. By that time Cupidon had become an accredited local  preacher, served as a translator several times a week and regularly conducted  pastoral visits to the sick, all on a voluntary basis.[9]

In 1828 Methodist missionary  Richard Marshall proposed to WMMS that Cupidon and his colleague Pierre Sallah  be employed as native agents. In his letter to WMMS, Marshall commended John  Cupidon with the words: &ldquo;He is deeply pious and has sustained an unblemished  character in the society ever since its commencement on the Island. I believe  all my predecessors could bear the same testimony… He has very correct views of  the doctrines of the gospel.&rdquo;[10]

Cupidon was appointed an assistant missionary by the  Methodist Conference in 1830, but due to  Marshall&rdquo;s untimely death, he was not informed of the appointment until  1831.[11] His first station was a position as a teacher in the school in Bathurst.  In 1832 Cupidon and his wife Mary, who was also literate, were transferred to  MacCarthy Island to nurture a Georgetown congregation and to start a school on  the island. Moister in his memoirs writes that he paid Cupidon and his wife  Mary for the work at MacCarthy from the stipend he received for temporary  acting as army chaplain.[12]

Only a few months later Cupidon  requested Moister &ldquo;if possible to pay him a visit, as the work was becoming too  big for him, and that several persons, both children and adults were waiting to  be received into the church by Christian baptism. He moreover informed me that  a number of couples were anxious to be lawfully married.&rdquo;[13] On Moister's  third visit to MacCarthy, barely a year after the Cupidons had started work  there, he stated:

I could not but observe the  change which had taken place in the appearance and the manners of the people  since I last addressed them. They presented themselves in the house of God  clean and neat in their apparel, and conducted themselves with reverence and  propriety becoming the solemnity of the occasion. I read prayers, and preached  with freedom and comfort to a deeply attentive congregation; after which I  baptised seven adults and sixteen children. The adults had been carefully  instructed and prepared for this sacred ordinance by the Native Teacher. (...)  This holy Sabbath was, indeed a day long to be remembered; and, had I not  actually beheld it, I could scarcely have believed that such a change could  have taken place in so short a time, through the simple teaching of a converted  African.[14]

Moister's conclusion was that  &ldquo;the work at MacCarthy having now become too weighty for a Native Assistant, I  renewed the application for a European Missionary.&rdquo;[15] The request for another  European missionary however was turned down, and – on the grounds that there  were more promising mission stations that required the scarce resources -, WMMS  refused to support the MacCarthy Mission. As also a new chaplain had arrived,  Moister&rdquo;s resources to pay the Cupidons had dried up. In 1832 however events  took a turn for the better. Through the intervention of former missionary John  Morgan, now stationed as a minister in Southampton, funds were raised for a  mission among the Fula; the money sufficed to pay a European missionary and two  native agents for a period of 5 years. Cupidon became one of the native agents  employed by this so-called Southhampton Committee; Pierre Sallah became the  other paid native agent.[16]  Cupidon  served at MacCarthy until 1835, when William Jouf took his place and Cupidon  was stationed at the school in St. Mary&rdquo;s.[17]

From 1835 onwards Cupidon seems  to have served at various Methodist stations, alternating between Barra,  Nyobantang, Bathurst, MacCarthy Island etc. He had become one of the senior and  most experienced indigenous agents and according to William Fox &ldquo;respected by  all who know him.&rdquo;[18] When in 1838 Fox embarked on his journey to the Fula  kingdom of Bondu, he chose Cupidon as his companion; in his report he  expressed approbation and respect for the way in which Cupidon had engaged in  discussions with Muslim in Bondu about the superiority of Christianity over  Islam.[19]

Cupidon&rdquo;s retirement in 1848 was  not voluntarily. He was suspended and later dismissed after several clashes  with his - much younger - European colleagues Benjamin Chapman and Matthew  Godman. It seems that tensions began to build up in 1846 when Cupidon and his  colleague Pierre Sallah opposed Chapman and Godman in enforcing the rule that  members should not marry unbelievers. Cupidon, possibly due to his experiences  in the Eurafrican world and his awareness of the harm that this enforcement  might cause the church, profoundly disagreed with the directive and send in his  resignation. The African leaders of the Leaders&rdquo; Meeting of the Bathurst Church,  who supported Cupidon in the conflict, mediated and persuaded Cupidon to  withdraw his resignation. In addition, they wrote several letters to Wesleyan Methodist  Missionary Society to complain about the conduct of Benjamin Chapman and  Matthew Godman. They asked WMMS to replace them – and especially Godman – with  people who would make no difference &ldquo;between a black man and a white man.&rdquo;[20] The conflict with Godman deepened to a personal level  when God­man flogged Cupidon&rdquo;s wife Mary, thinking she was a drunken school girl.  As rejoinder, Cupidon assaulted Godman. Though Godman apologized, the relation  between the two men continued to be strained and Cupidon asked to be  transferred to work upriver at Nyanibantang, away from Godman. He was refused with  the argument that he was needed as a teacher in the Bathurst school.

In 1848, after clashing with two  African colleagues, Amadi Ngum and Abraham Goddard, both of whom worked as native  agents for the church, Cupidon was suspended and then dismissed by the Leaders  Meeting, with the argument that he suffered from a form of insanity.[21] The  sources offer no insight as to why Cupidon had behaved so out of character.

The first generation of British  missionaries had treated the African native agents as colleagues and  counterparts. The attitude of the newer generation of missionaries towards the  African assistant missionaries differed profoundly from that of their  predecessors. Exceptions aside, they proved much more condescending towards  Africans, were convinced of European superiority and hence not free from  racism. This must have made work very difficult for the indigenous agents,  especially for the ones who had served for many years.

The synod of 1848 that dismissed  John Cupidon, also gave notice to [Pierre Sallah](sallah-pierre.html) after 17 years of service,  charging him with disobedience. John Gum, who had served the church since 1835,  was retired as well, albeit honorably and on medical grounds. A year earlier,  Chapman and Godman had suspended Gum&rdquo;s wife.[22] Thus, in one year, three of  the most experienced assistant missionaries were compulsorily retired; they and  their wives had been pivotal for the first decades of the Methodist Church in  The Gambia, serving the church in various capacities for 26  years, 17 years and 22 years respectively.

There is no record as to what became  of Cupidon after his dismissal. He died in 1853.[23]

Though speculative, the fact that Cupidon was given a  French name could indicate that Goree was still French possession at the time  of his birth. Great Britain captured Goree in 1803 and Saint Louis in 1809; the  possessions were returned to France in 1815. This would indicate a birth before  1803.

Fascinated by this phenomenon of frozen water Cupidon  decides to take some of it home to show his friends and relatives. Halfway the  journey home, checking up his treasure, he discovers that the snow had melted  and that the only thing left to show his friends were soaking wet clothes. W.

Me hungry for that  blessing; but me can't catch Him. Me go again in the evening and think perhaps  me catch Him there; but can't catch Him. Then me say, me sinner too big for  that blessing: me better go back and live devil-fashion again. That time you go  home, you go into my master's house; then me say, you can pray before you  leave, and perhaps me catch Him there. Me go and sit down at the door a long  time; but when my master call me, I go away; when I go back the door was shut;  then me say, all over now, me go back to country fashion. But then me say, me  pray all night first; and if I not get Him before morning, me then go back to  country fashion. Me go in the yard and kneel down on the sand, and pray till  garrison clock strike two; then come light all round me, and somebody say, 'My  son thy sins be forgiven;' and me glad too much.&quot; &quot;But what made you  glad?&quot; &quot;Because my sins forgiven.&quot; &quot;Are you sure that some  one spoke to you?&quot; &quot;Not sure, -but,&quot; putting his hand to his  heart, 'it make me so happy there.
