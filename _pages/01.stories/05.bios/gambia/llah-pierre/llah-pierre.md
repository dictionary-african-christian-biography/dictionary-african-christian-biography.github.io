Pierre  (sometimes spelled "Pear&rdquo;) Sallah was an assistant minister in the Methodist  Church of The Gambia. Sallah was among the first indigenous men who attained this  position. He was appointed in 1831 and served the Methodist Church for 17  years.

Sallah was a Wolof from present-day Senegal, probably originating  from the kingdom of Baol (called "Bawald Lambey&rdquo; in Moister 1889: 172). Born  around 1796 as a child of freeborn parents, he was kidnapped, enslaved, and  sold to a Mulatto woman in Goree, who trained him as a stonemason.[1] In 1818 his  owner hired him out to do construction work in Bathurst.

While in Bathurst, Sallah heard the missionary John Morgan  preach from Ezekiel 33:11 "turn away from your evil ways&rdquo; and the word hit him,  to quote his own words, "like a razor&rdquo;.[2] According to missionary William Moister,  Sallah thereupon &ldquo;burned his *greegrees* and abandoned the foolish Mohammedan superstitions, in which he had been  trained up from infancy&rdquo;[3], thus indicating that Sallah was a convert from  Islam.

The exact date of Sallah&rdquo;s conversion is uncertain. John  Morgan served in The Gambia between 1821 and 1825, but there is no record in  Morgan&rdquo;s letters or *Reminiscences* of  Sallah or his conversion. This could possibly indicate that Sallah converted  shortly before Morgan left for England in March 1825 and would imply that Sallah  was approximately 28 or 29 years old at the time.

It seems that Sallah had little or no formal education  and there are no indications that he had received some form of Islamic  education or was literate in Arabic. Morgan&rdquo;s successor, Richard Marshall and  William Moister gave Sallah sufficient private tutoring for him to conduct  services and work as assistant missionary, but most missionaries who worked  with him, commented at some point on his limited versatility in English. It  seems however that his lack of education was more than compensated by his piety  and zealousness. William Fox mentioned that Sallah was "energetic&rdquo; and "very  well received by the people.&rdquo;[4]

In 1829 Salleh was recalled to Goree by his owner. Encouraged  by Marshall and - it seems -  by his proprietor,  Sallah preached among fellow slaves in Goree, resulting in a small Methodist fellowship  among the slaves on the island. Marshall, who visited Sallah&rdquo;s fellowship in  February 1830, reported that there were around 15 members on trial.[5] Alarmed  by the possible effects of Sallah&rdquo;s preaching on their slaves, several slave  owners reported Sallah to the Governor. Also the resident Roman Catholic priest  was weary of the uninvited "competition&rdquo;. Sallah was arrested but not  convicted; he was however told to stop his preaching: "They threaten me; they  tell me I must not preach again; for black man no *sabby* (know) nothing.&rdquo; [6] Because Sallah expressed that he had no  intention of doing so, the Governor threatened with stronger measures. It was  from this precarious situation that Moister was able to ransom Sallah for the  sum of three hundred dollars: "I thank the good Methodist people, who get me  free from slavery and from the French Governor in Gorée.&rdquo; [7] The money for his  ransom had come from Ireland, after an appeal from The Gambia, probably made  by Moister.[8]

The congregation started by Sallah was neither temporary  nor of superficial nature. When missionary Thomas Dove visited Gorée in late  1833 to recuperate from illness, the members were still meeting. Dove was  invited to preach but there seems to have been no follow-up after this, no  doubt because Goree was French territory.[9]

Back in Bathurst Sallah was appointed as an non-stipendiary  assistant missionary to the Methodist Church in The Gambia where he assisted  Moister. It seems that he initially continued to work as a mason until 1831  when he was appointed to a paid position at MacCarthy island to work among the  Fula.[10] From 1833 onwards Sallah mainly served at MacCarthy island. After the  mission among the Fula proved a failure, Sallah served as assistant minister  among the liberated Africans who had been relocated to MacCarthy Island. The Methodist  Church also employed Sallah&rdquo;s wife Mary and his son John Sallah, both of whom  served as teachers at the school in Georgetown.

By the mid 1840 tensions began to surface. In 1846 the  African members of the Leaders Meeting of the Bathurst church wrote several  letters to Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society to complain about the conduct  of the missionaries Benjamin Chapman and Matthew Godman. They asked WMMS to  replace them – and especially Godman – with people who would make no difference  "between a black man and a white man.&rdquo;[11] Despite  protests by the Leaders Meeting, the two longest-serving African assistant  missionaries, both Pierre Sallah and his colleague [John Cupidon](cupidon-john.html) were  suspended. The Synod of 1848 changed the suspension into discharge of office, a  decision re-affirmed at the Special Synod of 1949. Cupidon was said to suffer  from "insanity&rdquo; and Sallah was charged with "disobedience.&rdquo;[11]

It seems that after his dismissal Pierre Sallah briefly  worked for the trader and nemesis of the Methodist Church Richard Lloyd but  died shortly afterwards. He had been a member of the church for about 25 years  and had served as its assistant missionary for more than 17 years. His wife  Mary, who had served the Methodist Church as a teacher, died in December 1852.[12]

Sallah  was exemplary for a whole generation of men who were vital in the earliest  decades of the Methodist Church in The Gambia. In an era when expatriate  missionary service was frequently cut short by illness and death, indigenous  agents such as Pierre Sallah, John Cupidon, the brothers John and Amadi Gum,  William Salleh, Robert McDonough and William Jouf, formed the mainstay of the  incipient Methodist Church of the Gambia. Few details about the life and work  of this first generation of indigenous agents have been preserved. However,  thanks to William Moister, contemporary and colleague to Sallah and Cupidon, who  recorded an autobiographical text of Pierre Sallah and part of the life-story of  John Cupidon in his publications, their lives and contributions were rescued  from oblivion.[13]

[1]  Sallah relates his captivity story in a letter to the Wesleyan Methodist  Missionary Society [WMMS]: &quot;Me was born  in a heathen Jalloff country, called Bawald Lambey, near Senegal, West Africa;  and brought up a shepherd's boy, as was my father before me. But one day my  father wanted me to go from home with him on some business: I leave the flocks  with one men till I come back; by my God, Who does everything for my good, not  let me go home again. When my father and I get to the place, I went into the  bush with some boys of that place to get some wild fruit. By and by I leave the  boys in that bush, for I think my father he want me. But when me get a little  way in the path, a bad man meet me in the way. O, that man have no pity for  little black boy! He put something in my mouth, because I make too much cry;  and then he take me to a dark bush, and he tie me there with a rope, and he  leave me there alone till midnight. Many bad animals live in that bush. Then  man come with two more men; they cut the rope: me then walk all night; me get  no supper. Three days me walk without food, only me drink little water. Me  think me must die for true that time; but at last me get to the main land near  Gorée, and they sell me there for rum, tobacco, and many other things, which I  see with my eyes.&rdquo; W. Moister, *Missionary  Stories. Narratives, scenes and incidents*, London: 1889, 172-3.

[2] Sallah narratives his conversion story as follows:  &ldquo;When I first hear the name of Jesus Christ, I ask the people who go to church  what they mean; they tell me that He is the Son of God, and that He die for all  the world. O, what mercy! When I know the Saviour's name, that time I no rest  at night. I go to some friend every night to teach me to read, for I not able  to read at the time, for every day I work; so then every night I get some  friend to teach me in the way of the Lord Jesus. I go on little more in reading  and praying to God. Every day my heart get a little nearer to God. I then ask  the Minister to let me go to Class; he says yes. There I hear more about Jesus,  and believe in Him with all my heart. O my God, I praise Thee! and Thee only  will I love.&rdquo; W. Moister, *Missionary stories*,  173.
