Thomas  Gregory Jobe was a Gambian Roman Catholic priest who served the Gambian Roman  Catholic Church for a period of ten years (1934-1944). In 1944, due to what  oral tradition postulates was racist conduct by one of his missionary  colleagues, Jobe left the Gambia. After a brief period as director of the  junior seminary in the Casamance, Jobe retired from the active priesthood and  pursued a secular career.

Thomas  Gregory Jobe was born in Bathurst in 1906 into a Roman Catholic family. His  father was a Wolof and his mother was of mixed Wolof Portuguese descent.[1] As  early as June 1922 Jobe&rsquo;s name appears in the Spiritan *Journal * *de la commuauté* because he, as a devoted Catholic youngster, had  become first in the country&rsquo;s school exams, thus doing both the Catholic  community and the Catholic education system proud. According to the *Journal, *Jobe won a price of £4 and a  picture of the British royal family (sic !) for this achievement.[2] Shortly  afterwards, Jobe was admitted into the Minor Seminary in Ngasobil (Senegal)  where he befriended Leopold Senghore, who later became the architect of the  Négritude movement and Senegal&rsquo;s first president. After two years in Senegal, Jobe  continued his theological training in France.

Jobe  was ordained on October 11, 1933 in Paris by Bishop Le Hunsec, former Vicar  Apostolic of the Senegambia.[3]. On  October 14, 1934 he celebrated his first mass in the Gambia, called a red  letter day in the Spiritan *Journal * *de la communauté*.  It seems he addressed the people in the vernacular.[4] One of his Irish  colleagues, Fr.  Whiteside, told the congregation: &ldquo;Receive him with joy into your midst. He is  of your soil, of your race, he understands your mentality, your language, your  customs, better than any European priest can ever do.&rdquo;[5]

The  archives offer preciously little information about Jobe&rsquo;s ministry in the  Gambia. The Irish Spiritan missionary Fr. John Meehan, who served as superior  of the mission, asked Jobe to be in charge of the Bathurst parish. He initially  seems to have hoped that Jobe would become the administrative superior, which  would give him (Meehan) time for mission work.]6] To familiarize Jobe to the  mission extension work, Meehan took Jobe on a tour through the country, first  to Combo, which was part of the Bathurst parish and later also up country to  Basse.[7] In the late 1830s Jobe&rsquo;s name is also mentioned in connection with evangelization  work among Jola who lived in Bathurst and surroundings. In 1938 a group of  adult Jola whom Jobe had nurtured into the Christian faith was baptized.[8]

Unexpectedly  and without further explanation the *Journal* mentions on January 18, 1944 that Jobe had left the country for Senegal without  saying goodbye.[9] Later sources suggest that there had been tensions between  him and Meehan, which came to a head in January 1944 and caused Jobe to leave  the country. Oral tradition intimates that racism played a prominent role in  the strained relations between Jobe and Meehan.[10]

After  he left the Gambia, Jobe worked for some years (1944-1946) as the Director of  the Minor Seminary in Carabane, in the Casamance.[11] In 1946 he left the  active priesthood. After a period as a private tutor in Senegal, he left for France.  In 1960, when Senegal had become independent, President Senghore offered him  Senegalese citizenship and invited him to work in Senegal, first as Senegal&rsquo;s  representative to UNESCO in Paris, later as the Ambassador for Senegal to Ghana  and Italy. When Jobe retired, he settled in Ivory Coast.[12]

In  1975, Jobe – still highly esteemed and respected by people - was invited to  return to the Gambia. After his homecoming he lived a quiet life until his  death on January 30, 1995, occasionally helping out with the formation of  catechists.[13]

The case of Jobe had a long-lasting impact on the  indigenous vocations in the Gambia. Parents objected to their sons &ldquo;being made  slaves for the missionaries&rdquo; and discouraged plans to offer for the priesthood.[14] Because of the impact  on vocations and because  Jobe was still highly esteemed by the Gambian Roman Catholic community,  several attempts were made by clergy in the Gambia to resolve the situation with Jobe and  to restore him to the priesthood.  The first Bishop of Banjul, Bp. Michael Moloney wrote to the Superior General  of the Congregation of the Holy Ghost:

> Since my appointment I have been  naturally preoccupied with trying to encourage African vocations, as was my  predecessor. We both find ourselves against the same difficulty – the fact that  our last man, Father Jobe, abandoned the obligations of the priesthood. There  is no doubt but that he still holds a large place in the affections of the  people here, and that there will be no keenness among them towards promoting  vocations, if his position is not cleared up. I know how difficult it is, as  Father Farrelly and others have already met him on a few occasions. May I  respectfully suggest to you a further attempt from a different angle of  approach. My suggestion may show more keenness than feasibility and you will be  able to decide yourself. It is that you yourself or possibly the Archbishop  LeHunsec (who was his former Vicar Apostolic) see him and explain to him that I  personally and all the Fathers, and especially the people, would be delighted  to see him restored to his former position and that I have written to you to  that effect.

But it seems that the  Superior General did not support these efforts and no official attempts at  reconciliation were made.[15]  Thus the incident of Jobe haunted Gambian vocations  for the priesthood for nearly forty years.

That Rome  has informed us that no form of reconciliation (public) will be insisted on,  unless he has entered on any civil matrimonial contract, which would have legal  complications. I am assured, on reliable authority, that nothing like this has  taken place, and that his conduct has been in the circumstances, excellent. I  foresee one big difficulty in the way of his return. It is the presence of  Father Meehan.
>

> I do not at all  consider that Fr. Meehan had any major responsibility for Fr. Jobe&rsquo;s action,  but the fact remains that in Father Jobe&rsquo;s mind and in the people&rsquo;s unfounded  opinion, it was the clash between him and Father Meehan which prepared the way  for the final bolt. If this proved to be the only obstacle, I would be prepared  to ask Meehan to remain in Ireland. This would be a hard step but the return of  Fr. Jobe would be so important for the future of the mission here, that I am  sure Fr. Meehan would be prepared to make this additional sacrifice for the  Gambia.

Moloney to Superior General, Bathurst  April 7 1952, Box 4I11B, File IV letters 1951-1955. On the letter a comment is  written: Fa. Jobe must shed some of his terrible pride first. Signed: F.G.  16-5-1952. Thus no further action was taken.
