Known by her Christian name, Dona Beatrice, she  emerged as a popular prophetic figure after a long period of political decline among the Kongo.  She claimed to be the incarnation of the Portuguese Saint Anthony.  For two years she preached a form of Christian anti-Catholicism which emphasized traditional Kongo symbolism and cultural roots.  The Kongo king, Pedro IV, under pressure from missionaries at his court, had her burned at the stake as a heretic.  Her Antonian church survived her passing and briefly provided a focus for the revitalization of the kingdom in the 18th century.
