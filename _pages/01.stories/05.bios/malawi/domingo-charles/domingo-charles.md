He was born in Mozambique and brought to present Malawi by his father in 1881.  He soon became attached to the Free Church of Scotland mission at Livingstonia, where he was baptized. By the time he was twenty, he was considered one of the mission's leading prot&eacute;g&eacute;s.  However, in *c.*1917 he began to break from the mission to preach on his own.  He was influenced by the teachings of Joseph BOOTH and seems to have affiliated with both the Seventh Day Adventists and the Watch Tower Movement [see E. K. KAMWANA].

From 1910 to 1916 he organized a chain of Seventh Day Adventist missions in northern Malawi (then called Nyasaland) and took an increasingly vocal stance against the European administration of the country. He was not connected with the violent rising of John CHILEMBWE in southern Nyasaland in 1915, but the government - now greatly alarmed by dissident Africans - deported him the following year.
