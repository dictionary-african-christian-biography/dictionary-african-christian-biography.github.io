English Missionary.

Throughout his career he frequently shifted his affiliation among different Christian denominations, but consistently championed African's rights.  In 1892 he opened his first station for the Baptists in Malawi, where an early convert was John CHILEMBWE, the leader of a 1915 rebellion against the British.  He traveled with Chilembwe to the United States in 1897, where they separated permanently.  Booth's influence on Chilembwe's later career has never been satisfactorily established.

Booth returned to southern Africa to launch a series of new  missions under a succession of denominations.  He frequently clashed with European authorities over political issues.  Suspected of complicity on Chilembwe's 1915 rising, he was expelled from South Africa and returned to England destitute.
