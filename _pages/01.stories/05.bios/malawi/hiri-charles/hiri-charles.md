Rev. S. Greystone Charles Phiri was born on August 10, 1958 at Sorgin in Malawi into a family of six children. He completed a primary and secondary school education.

He testified to finding the Lord: "On September 9, 1987 I was on the way to Bangula Trading Centre when I met a preacher who said to me, 'Young boy, be prepared. The Son of God is coming right now!  If the only begotten Son of God died for us; what about you and me?' I found the Lord and joined the Church of the Nazarene." Realizing a call to preach, he did his theological studies in Blantyre at at the Bangwe Nazarene Bible College.

His wife was Mary and she was from the same home village as Charles. They were married in 1978 while he wad doing his theological studies. They had five sons: Enock, Madalitso (Blessings), Silas, Moses and Chifundo (Mercy).

From 1981 to 1983 they pastored in Salima.  Then from 1983 to 1985 they pastored the Dedza church and he was ordained as a minister in 1985. [1] From 1985 to 1992 they pastored the Balaka Market Church and in 1992 went to the Nkhota-kota Church  where they served unil his death. [2]

In 2003 they were serving the Nkhota-kota Church and the Evan Kasamba and Liudzi preaching points on the Lakeshore District. He explains: "This was where Livingtone met Jumbe and stopped him from buying people for slaves.  It is a strong Muslim community.  Many of the church members are converts from Islam." [3]

In 2005 Phiri wrote,: "I thank God because He calls me to his ministry. I thank the Church of the Nazarene for its doctrines."  He is thankful that three of their children are receiving help for their schooling through the Pastors Assistance Program.  "Because of the failure of the rains during the past year there is much suffering from lack of food and the people are struggling with extreme poverty." [4]

Rev. Charles Phiri, Pastor of Nkhotakhota Church of the Nazarene, Malawi Lakeshore District passed away unexpectedly on Sunday, November 2, 2008. [5]
