Lorenzo Rosano was born at Canosio, in the province of Cuneo, Italy, on January 18, 1903. He attended the diocesan seminary of Cuneo and completed his humanistic and philosophical education there. Then he was accepted in the IMC (Consolata Missionaries) where he completed his theological and missionary preparation and was ordained on January 29, 1928. In the same year he was sent to Kenya where he worked until the beginning of World War II, when he was taken to South Africa as a prisoner of war. After the war, he returned to Kenya and dedicated himself to various missionary activities in Nyeri and finally in Marsabit Diocese, where he was one of the pioneers at Maralal and in Samburu District. Because of ill health he returned to Italy in 1973. He died at Alpignano, Torino, on March 16, 1990.
