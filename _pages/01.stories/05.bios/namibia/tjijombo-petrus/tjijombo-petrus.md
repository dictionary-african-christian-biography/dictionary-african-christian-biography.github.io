Bishop Petrus Tjijombo was the founder of St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission in Namibia.  He was born in 1936 in Kaokoland.  In 1952, Petrus had a dream in which God called him to the Christian ministry. In 1953, he moved to Windhoek with his parents and started a personal ministry under the auspices of the Oruuano Church.  While in Windhoek, he heard about the Wilberforce Institute of the AME Church in Evaton, south of Johannesburg, offering theological education for Africans (Tjijombo 2002, cf. Sundermeier 1973:121).   He was admitted and studied for two years at the institute.

On his return to Namibia in 1955, Tjijombo again joined the ministry of Oruuano for four years until 1959.  That year, he returned to the Wilberforce Institute in Evaton to continue his studies for the office of evangelist. While in Evaton, Tjijombo discovered the headquarters of the St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission (SJAFM), founded by the remarkable woman prophet, Ma Nku (Sundermeier 1973:122-123).  The SJAFM was a Zionist secession from the Pentecostal Movement, which had a following of 180,000 members in 1968 (Strassberger 1969:4).  Tjijombo became a member of the SJAFM after being re-baptized by Bishop Masango, and being ordained as preacher.  He was sent back to Namibia to establish the SJAFM in 1960.

After his return to Namibia, Tjijombo's work was immediately criticized by Ruzo and Kanambunga of the Oruuano as an *Omuzeva* (in Afrikaans, *Wederdoper* or Anabaptist).  They circulated a letter of warning.  Consequently, his original following was limited.   The situation changed for the better when Thusnelda Hambuindja, a female prophet from Botswana, joined the work of Tjijombo after she settled in Windhoek in 1960.  She was highly respected by the Herero people and was addressed as "mother."  Many Herero people supported her in the SJAFM.

In 1960, Tjijombo built his first church in the village of Chief Munjuku of the Mbanderu tribe in the Epukiro Reserve. The beginning was a time of magnificent growth for the SJAFM, with three services per day.  The AFM / Zionist traditions including Sunday worship services through healing ministries and adult baptism with submersion were followed, continuing the SJAFM pattern of Ma Nku of Evaton.  The church also spread to the Aminuis Reserve.  Ecstatic prophetic utterances occurred under the SJAFM ministries in both Epukiro and Aminuis.

In 1964, the Mbanderu established their own tribal church, called the Church of Africa, under the leadership of Daniel Kandjavera.  Although Tjijombo was offered the position of prophet in the Church of Africa (positioned under Kandjavera's leadership), he declined.  Even though he lost considerable influence among the Mbanderu people, he stayed true to his principles as a pentecostal preacher, under the authority of the prophet Ma Nku.

Bishop Petrus Tjijombo is still alive and ministering in Windhoek.[1]
