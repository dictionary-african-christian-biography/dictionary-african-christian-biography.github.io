James  Adeoti Adenike was born into the Adenike family of Alahoro quarters in Koso,  Iseyin, a few years before the British finally colonized what is today known as  Nigeria. Iseyin is an ancient town, the headquarters of the Iseyin Local  Government Area, in the present Oyo State of Nigeria. His younger brother, Samuel  Akano Adeleke, the late *Bada* of Koso  area of Iseyin, reported that Adeoti Adenike was born circa June 1884, and that  his father was a cloth weaver and a farmer.[1]  His progenitors migrated from the Isale Oyo area of the ancient town of  Oyo, in what is known as Oyo State of Nigeria today. Isale Oyo was reputed for  worshipping *Egungun*, an ancestral deity  mythologically believed to have come down from heaven. Hence, the *Egungun* is usually referred to as &ldquo;*ara orun,*&rdquo; that is, a &ldquo;visitor from  heaven.&rdquo;

*Egungun* is the worship  of spirits or the souls of departed ancestors. According to Samuel Johnson, a  traditional Yoruba historian, the departed ancestors are represented as &ldquo;human  beings of the exact height and figure of the deceased, covered from head to  foot with clothes similar to those in which the said deceased was known to have  been buried, completely masked and speaking with an unnatural voice.&rdquo;[2] Speaking  further, he states that the *Egungun* worship has become a national religious institution, and its anniversaries are  celebrated with grand festivities. The mysteries connected with it are held  sacred and inviolable, and although little boys of five or six years of age are  often initiated, no woman may know these mysteries on pain of death. It is considered  a crime to touch *Egungun* regalia in  public, and disrespectful to pass him by with the head uncovered. Even a boy *Egungun* is considered worthy of being  honored by his (supposed) surviving parents, he salutes them as elderly people  would do, and promises the bestowal of gifts on the family.[3]

This  information suggests that Adeoti Adenike&rsquo;s parents were devotees of *Egungun,* the ancestral deity. His  parents had many *Egungun* outfits,  which they revered. Two of his younger brothers bore names reflecting *Egungun* worship. These are Abioje (a  child born into the *Egungun* worship),  and Egungundiran (*Egungun* worship that  has become generational).  Adeoti Adenike  was living in this *Egungun* religious context  when Christianity was introduced to the Iseyin community in 1898 by the Church  Missionary Society (Anglican), the Methodist Mission 1908, and the Baptist  Mission in 1918.

The  Iseyin/Okeho tax riot of 1916/1917 was highly instrumental to the conversion  and establishment of Christianity in Iseyin. In Okeho (another town in the Oke-Ogun  area of Oyo State), the people reacted to the imposition of taxes by the  British Colonial administration through violent protests. In an attempt to lend  a brotherly assistance, the people of Iseyin joined the anti-tax protests. The  British authority responded decisively and killed some of the citizens of the  two communities. In Iseyin, it even led to the death of a traditional monarch, Aseyin  Lawoyin. Life then became unbearable to many citizens of Iseyin, including Adeoti  Adenike, who fled the town to seek security elsewhere, at least, for some time  to allow the dust to settle and normalcy to return to the ancient community. Some  of them who fled to Lagos, Badagry and Abeokuta later came back as Christians,  having been converted during their exile. One of these exiles was Adenike. He  and his brother, the late Chief Samuel Akano Adeleke, took keen interest in  Christianity, in order to have access to western education, even if it would  only afford them the advantage of reading and writing.  For that same purpose, the duo led others to  become Christians.

Incidentally,  Adenike was favorably disposed to being a Baptist. The Baptist mission thus  owes its history in Iseyin to Adenike. Samuel Adeleke, his younger brother,  recounted how Adenike, with his like-minded friends John Ayoola (a.k.a. &ldquo;Ayo-Alagba,&rdquo;)  Paa Siyanbola, Benjamin Egbediji, and Oluokun, an elder brother of Adenike,  were determined to have a Christian denomination different from the CMS  (Anglican). These individuals agreed, and sent Adenike to Aawe, (a town very  near Oyo town) where the Baptist variety of the Christian faith had already  been established. His mission to Aawe was to go and look for a pioneer Baptist  pastor to lay the foundation of the Baptist denomination in Iseyin.

Adenike  made three unsuccessful trips to Aawe. His failures to secure a Baptist pastor  from Aawe led some of his friends to reconsider their choice and throw in their  lot with the Methodist Mission which came in 1908.  Nevertheless, Adenike and his group members  were undaunted, resolute, and hopeful that the Baptist in Aawe would send them a  Baptist pastor. Their hope hinged on the fact that the Aawe Baptists had sent a  visibility survey team to Iseyin, to inspect the location for the new church. Their  dream became a reality in 1918, when Pastor Robert Ogunbileje was sent from  Aawe to start a Baptist church in Iseyin. They broke ground and the new church  was named First Baptist Church, Koso, Iseyin.

Adenike  housed Robert Ogunbileje, the pioneer pastor of the church at Abala compound  from where the pastor carried out his pastoral assignments. The first church  building was built on a low-hill called &ldquo;Laseinsin,&rdquo; and from there it  metamorphosed into a church to reckon with in the Nigerian Baptist Convention. Adenike  led the church to secure a large expanse of land from the Atoogun family,  where the present First Baptist Church was built. In 1942, a primary school was  built alongside the church and in 1956 a Secondary Modern School was also  founded on the same expanse of land. The Modern School was upgraded into a full  Secondary Grammar School in 1980. Adenike adopted the Hebrew/Galilean name  &ldquo;James&rdquo; and many of his admirers changed their Egungun names as well.

In  1921 Adenike married Madam Olawumi. Olawumi was the daughter of the priest of the *Oro* cult, from the Aaba Compound, in  Itan quarters of Iseyin. The aboriginal inhabitants of Iseyin worshipped Oro,  another traditional deity in Yorubaland. The town&rsquo;s cognomen or appellation was  Iseyin Oro, that is Iseyin that is reputed for worshipping Oro. It is  forbidden for women to see Oro, and death was the penalty for even peeping to  spy on Oro. Samuel Johnson affirms that among the Oyo people of South-Western  Nigeria, the people of Iseyin and Jabata are the principal worshippers of Oro.[4]  The marriage was blessed with four children - two boys and two girls.  Adenike had two other wives who bore him four other children.

Adenike  was very influential in the community. One of his nephews, Abioje Benjamin  Osuolale reiterated that his uncle drew many of his friends and relatives to  Christianity by being philanthropic and accommodating. Osuolale added that it  was his hobby to see people out of financial problems, so much, so that he was  given the praise-name: *Ab&rsquo;owo gbogboro,  tii y&rsquo;mo re l&rsquo;ofin*, meaning, &ldquo;the one who has very long hands to pull out  his children from troubles.&rdquo; Osuolale also recounted how older people from the  church used to come on daily basis to seek for advice and other assistance. He  said that during the annual harvest thanksgiving, Christmas, Easter, and the New  Year, Adenike&rsquo;s house was usually besieged by visitors, Christians and  non-Christians alike. He was greatly revered in the community. His life history  is more or less synonymous with the founding and growth of First Baptist  Church, Koso, Iseyin. He had the singular honour of being the treasurer of the  church for forty-nine years, from 1918 to 1967, when he died.

James  Adeoti Adenike was a great man and a patriarch. On May 8,  1967, he was going on a business trip to Lagos, as a seller of popular  hand-woven clothes (&ldquo;Aso Oke&rdquo;). He begged the driver of the vehicle to allow  him to go back home and take some personal effects. When he got home, however, he  slept to wake no more. Truly, &ldquo;Sweet is the death of the saints.&rdquo; To honour  him, he was buried in the church yard, and a church society called *Imo-Oluwa Adenike* (The Knowledge of the Lord Society) was named after him.
