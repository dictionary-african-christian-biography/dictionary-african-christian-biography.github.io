Robert Louis Prazan, O.P., was born on September 5, 1936,
in Chicago, Illinois, the oldest of the two children of Louis J. Prazan and
Lillian Mary Rasch. He attended St. Leonard Grammar School, Berwyn, Illinois,
and Fenwick High School, Oak Park, Illinois. Before entering the Dominican
novitiate at St. Peter Martyr Priory, Winona, Minnesota, in August 1956, he
attended Loras College, Dubuque, Iowa, for two years.

He was given the religious name, Ceslaus, and made first profession at
Winona on August 31, 1957. He was then assigned to St. Thomas Aquinas Priory
(Dominican House of Studies), River Forest, Illinois, for philosophical
studies (1957-60), earning a Bachelor in Philosophy degree. After profession
of solemn vows on August 31, 1960, he went to Dubuque, Iowa, for theological
studies at Aquinas Institute, School of Theology (1960-64). There on April 15,
1963, Bishop George J. Biskup ordained him a priest in the chapel of St. Rose
of Lima Priory.

After completion of basic studies Father Prazan was assigned to the foreign
missions in Nigeria, West Africa, where he was to spend the next twenty-two
years of his priestly ministry. After a brief stay in Gusau, Zamfara State, he
was assigned as an assistant pastor at St. Dominic Parish, Yelwa, Northern
Nigeria, where he spent the next nine years (1965-74) engaged in
pre-evangelization work among the Dukkawa people. In the book *The Dukkawa
of Northwest Nigeria* he tells the story of these people. Then for three
years (1974-77) he served as assistant pastor at St. Vincent Ferrer Parish,
Malumfashi, Northern Nigeria, among the Maguzawa, an ancient Hausa-speaking
people.

In 1977 he began the third phase of his missionary work which was to
continue until his return to the United States in November, 1986. During this
time he was stationed at Our Lady of Fatima Parish, Gusau, Zamfara State, and
devoted his efforts to full-time preaching and writing in Hausa. To help
eradicate illiteracy he produced a very popular aid for teaching
Hausa-speakers to read â€”*Karatu: "Rashin sani ya fi dare duhu"*. For
English-speakers learning the Hausa language he wrote *Hausa Hints*
(1978) and *Hausa proverbs for preaching* (1978). Gone on leave on 8
March 1979, he returned to write *Grasping the Rosary* and (in Hausa)
*Rosari*, and later *Marriage matters*. Among his other writings
were two small booklets on the miracles of Jesus.  In addition to the
written word he extended his preaching by producing tapes.

In November, 1986, one year after Nigeria had become an independent
province, Father "Ces" returned to the United States, and spent some months in
reorienting himself to his native country. He spent six months in campus
ministry at South Dakota State University, Brookings, South Dakota, and then
explored preaching team ministry in McAllen, Texas. While providing temporary
supply help at Our Lady of Pompeii Parish, Tickfaw, Louisiana, Father Prazan
found the second love of his priestly ministry. From March, 1988, until his
death he served the people of this parish.

In early summer of 1997 "Ces" was diagnosed as having a malignant
inoperable tumor in his chest. Chemotherapy and radiation treatments followed.
After a brief remission, the cancer began to spread and, in spite of
additional chemotherapy treatments, it continued to ravage his body, but not
his spirit. He continued his pastoral work at Our Lady of Pompeii parish as
long as he was able. His conditioned worsened and on the afternoon of July 5,
1998, because of severe difficulty in breathing, he was rushed to the hospital
in Hammond, Louisiana. Efforts to review him were futile. His funeral Mass was
celebrated at his beloved parish on July 8, 1998, with burial in the Dominican
plot at Rosaryville, Louisiana.
