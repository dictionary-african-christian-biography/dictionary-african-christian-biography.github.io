![Jacob Ade Ajayi](/images/bio-pics/nigeria/ade-ajayi/ade-ajayi.jpg){:class="bio"}

Jacob  Festus Ade Ajayi was a pioneer in the study of African history who highlighted native perspectives and the complexities of colonial-era change.

**Life Story**

Ajayi  was born May 26, 1929 in Ikole Ekiti, western Nigeria, to Christian parents,  Ezekiel Adeniyi Ajayi, a postmaster and later private secretary to the area's  ruler, and Comfort Bolajoko. Jacob went to Igbobi College, Lagos. He was a  foundation student at University College, Ibadan (which became the University  of Ibadan) before moving to University College, Leicester (now Leicester  University). He gained his PhD in African history in 1958 at the University of  London.

In  1956, he married Christie Aduke Martins, a teacher and specialist in early  childhood education. They had five children, Yetunde, Niyi, Funmilayo,  Titilola, and Bisola.

Working  mainly at the University of Ibadan, Ajayi was a lecturer (1958-63), professor  (1963-89), and then emeritus professor. He was a leading light, with the late  Kenneth Dike, of the Ibadan history school, an influential group of Nigerian  and foreign academics in the university's history department dedicated to  formulating an Afro-centric view of the continent's past. The group started the *Journal of the Historical Society of  Nigeria* to counter journals elsewhere that still adhered to colonialist and  racist views. He was also a founder of the Ibadan History Series, produced with  Longmans during the 1960s, a series of scholarly works providing new  perspectives on African history.

From  1972 to 1978, Ajayi was vice-chancellor of the University of Lagos. He took  over a demoralized institution; when he left, it was of international standing.  He reorganized the ramshackle academic structures and put in place a  corruption-proof appointments system. However, collision came with the military  government, which faced student protests when it put up fees. The university,  being the nearest to government headquarters, was encircled by armed police and  a student was shot dead, for no apparent reason. Ajayi reacted by organizing a  moving funeral on campus. He was summarily dismissed and went back to Ibadan. A  colleague said: &quot;I never heard him raise his voice.&quot;

Ajayi  was a great believer that historical knowledge should serve the everyday world.  He was a major influence in reforming the Nigerian school curriculum to reflect  Africa-focused research, working with the examination system and government  policymakers, and helping produce appropriate textbooks.

Outside  academia, he used his skills as a historian to assist traditional rulers in  assessing their post-colonial roles, and occasionally to mediate quietly  between state governors, while never becoming involved in partisan politics. He  also solved a problem for national census-takers, who had to deal with  non-literate people unaware of their age; he prepared a special handbook of  important historical events, so that if, for instance, someone said she was  born in the year of influenza, they could record 1918. He played an active role  in many international bodies, including the International Africa Institute in  London.

**Legacy**

Ajayi  was a trailblazer in the field of African history. Before Ajayi, historians of  Africa generally privileged the points of view of outsiders to the  continent—colonialists, missionaries and other non-native-Africans. It remains  in use by teachers and students today.   Ajayi collaborated with Ian Espie on a book called *A Thousand Years of West African History* (1965), which educators  still use today. The book drew from the archaeological record and from primary  African sources, many of them in Arabic.

Ajayi  charted a new course for African historiography by offering a balanced  treatment of both western and African perspectives. In his book *Christian Missions in Nigeria 1841-91* (1964), Ajayi asserted that the century of colonialism, before Nigeria became  independent in 1960, was actually a brief period in history, and that the  colonizers worked through established African institutions rather than setting  up their own structures.

Ajayi  also wrote a biography of Samuel Ajayi Crowther, the first African bishop in the  Anglican Church, entitled *A Patriot to  the Core*.  In it, Ajayi showed that  the advent of Nigerian Christianity created a new class of elites, Africans  educated by the West, whose aims often diverged from those of the established  leadership. In a paper for the *Journal of  the Historical Society of Nigeria,* published in 1960, he contended that the  19th century saw an early nationalism germinating in this elite class.

As  dedicated as he was to emphasizing identity for Nigerian and African people, he  was also intent on not glorifying the past. In 2010, he was one of eight  Nigerian historians to contribute to *Slavery  and Slave Trade in Nigeria*, which made the case that the traditional  academic focus on the external slave trade, particularly the trans-Atlantic  trade to Europe, the Americas, and the Caribbean had underplayed the importance  of the much older indigenous trans-Saharan and trans-Indian Ocean trades.

In  this work, as in others, Ajayi was innovative in his use of a combination of  oral and written history, which he was meticulous in evaluating. This allowed  him to present African voices authoritatively to counterbalance the European  and American perspective. Ajayi once said: &quot;People of my generation  learned how Britannia ruled the world,&quot; and he made it his life's work to  change that.

Jacob  Festus Ade Ajayi died August 9, 2014. He was eulogized by the Nigerian  president, Goodluck Jonathan, as having &quot;a lasting place of honor as one  of Africa's greatest historians.&quot; His contribution was recognized by a  state funeral in Nigeria.
