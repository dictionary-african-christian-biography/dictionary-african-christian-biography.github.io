---% Notes %------------
I found this website https://calmview.bham.ac.uk/Record.aspx?src=Catalog&id=XHT that has a photo of Dr. Harold Turner.
It is from the University of Birbmingham Cadbury Research library.
The webpage says that "photocopies are not allowed to be re-copied by researchers or staff", which I guess means that I can't
save a copy and put it on the website.
But it's there, if that ever becomes a possibility!

It also has a GREAT and very thorough biography of this man.
