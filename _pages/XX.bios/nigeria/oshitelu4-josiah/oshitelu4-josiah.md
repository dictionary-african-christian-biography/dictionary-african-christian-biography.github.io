**Introduction**

Primate Josiah Olunowo Ositelu (Psy.D) is the most  prestigious and the first transnational head of an African Indigenous Church (AIC)  in Nigeria.[1] His most popular portrait, which shows him dressed in the full  regalia of a church primate, betrays his Anglican roots and his ambition to become  head of an equivalent church—an aspiration that was fulfilled. Ositelu&rsquo;s TCLAW was  officially inaugurated in his hometown of Ogere in southwestern Nigeria on July  27, 1930 [2], with ten members. It became one of the fastest growing AICs soon  after its establishment. The Church rapidly started branches in towns in western,  northern, and eastern Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Ghana, and the United  Kingdom. [3]****

**His Birth and Spiritual  Development**

Josiah Ositelu was born in Ogere on May 15, 1900. [4] Like other  legendary prophetic figures and religious leaders, countless mysteries were  woven around his birth and ministry. It is claimed that when he was born his  parents consulted diviners to ascertain the fate of their baby. The diviners  assured the parents that the baby would not only live but would be an unusual  child. It was further predicted that he would be spiritually powerful, influential,  and wise—a trailblazer and a guide of both Europeans and Africans showing them  the ways of the Lord. [5] As he grew up, he demonstrated much zeal for the  supernatural. It was reported that he prophesied about the future; revealed  unknown secrets from the past; read signs in the sky; detected witches; and had  unusual dreams in which he was taught by holy beings. [6]****

**His Call**

Ositelu received his elementary education from 1913-1919  in Ogere and Ijebu-Ode, in the present Ogun State of Nigeria, After his  elementary education, he served in the Anglican Church as a catechist and pupil  teacher. He was preparing for admission into St. Andrew's College, Oyo to  become a trained teacher when, on the night of May 17, 1925, he had a strange  visionary experience which troubled and left him agitated. [7] He saw a large  eye as big as the head of a cow &ldquo;reflecting as a great orbit of the sun.&rdquo; [8] On  enquiry, an old prophet named Samuel Somoye explained these encounters to mean &ldquo;a  call to service.&rdquo; Prophet Somoye counseled Ositelu on how to overcome the  spiritual warfare through the medium of prayer and fasting. [9]

The authorities of the Anglican Church soon noticed Ositelu&rsquo;s  activities and frowned on them. They reprimanded him and strongly advised him to  desist from his &ldquo;hyper-spiritual&rdquo; practices since they were at variance with those  of the church. When Ositelu adamantly refused to comply, he was initially  suspended but later dismissed by the Abeokuta District Council of the Anglican  Church. After his dismissal, he worked briefly as a clerk for one of his aunts,  but he spent most of the time there in prayer and fasting.[10] By August 31,  1926, Ositelu felt fully convinced, after many visionary experiences that he  had been commissioned to propagate the gospel and needed to warm up for the  great assignment ahead. [11] In 1927, he submitted himself to spiritual  discipleship under Prophet Somoye. He developed his spiritual gifts and after  two years he emerged as a prophetic preacher and public crusader with the  mandate to &ldquo;give the water of life to the thirsty.&rdquo;

**Expansion of His Ministry

**

Ositelu conducted his first open air revival on the June 9,  1929. From that moment, the fame of his open air services spread like wild fire.  During his revivals there were many miracles and acts of healing; people renounced  idols, charms, and *Egungun *apparels,  which they usually surrendered to him for destruction. People came from the  farthest reaches of Nigeria to visit Ogere-Remo, his headquarters, and to  witness the marvelous manifestations of the power of God. Before the advent of  Christianity, medicine-men popularly referred to as *Babalawo* were the homegrown healers and therapist of the time. However,  with the advent of *Aladura* movements,  prophets like Ositelu claimed to possess and exercise divine powers and the  ability to deal with witches, wizards, evil spirits, and ill-wishers who were a  major source of fear and anxiety in the society. He inaugurated his Church with  only ten members hoping to entice more to join.

**TCLAW&rsquo;s Unique Ministry**

Ositelu operated with undaunted spiritual power, majoring  in deliverance exercises. As a result, soon other AIC leaders regarded his  ministry favorably and his fame spread quickly. Even though Ositelu seems to have  recognized the relevance of the African worldview and culture in energizing the  Christian faith in his society, he censured the *babalawo*, and expressed his disapproval of idolatry, native charms,  and traditional medicine. He practiced faith healing that sometimes required  the use of elements such as olive oil, sanctified water, honey, incense, and  coconut oil. Like other *Aladura* movements,  TCLAW always emphasized the dual efficacy of prayer and fasting. However, TCLAW  has unique practices that include the celebration of a spiritual festival  called *Tabieorar*, the use of holy  words and names, engagement in spiritual exercises like rolling on the ground, jumping,  clapping, and laughing hilariously when giving testimonies as well as the toleration  and baptism of polygamists.****

**Succession in the TCLAW**

Today, TCLAW is a worldwide organization with 3,800  parishes, 100 dioceses, and twelve provinces spread throughout Nigeria, Sierra  Leone, Liberia, Ghana, Togo, Ivory Coast, Benin, the United Kingdom, Germany, Luxembourg,  Spain, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. TCLAW is also a member of  prominent diverse organizations that include the World Council of Churches  (WCC), the All Africa Council of Churches (AACC), Global Christian Forum (GCF),  and the Christian Council of Nigeria (CCN).

Since Josiah Oshitelu died on the July 12, 1966, TCLAW has witnessed  three successful successions: Emmanuel Adeleke Adejobi (1967-1991); Gabriel  Olusegun Oshitelu (1991-1998), and Rufus Okikiola Ositelu (1999-). TCLAW is (1)  biblical in pattern, (2) Pentecostal in power, (3) evangelical in mission,(4),  ecumenical in outlook,(5) prophetic in ministry and (6) social in  responsibility. [12] With these enticing tenets and mission TCLAW will continue  to flourish.
