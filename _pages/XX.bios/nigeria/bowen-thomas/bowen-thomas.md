Thomas Jefferson Bowen was a Southern Baptist missionary in Nigeria. He was born in Jackson County, Georgia, and arrived in Nigeria in 1850, the pioneer Southern Baptist missionary in the area. In 1853 he settled at Ijaye, in Yorubaland, and with the assistance of American colleagues established other stations in Ogbomosho and Abeokuta. He became a Yoruba scholar of considerable standing, publishing a dictionary and grammar of the language after his early retirement due to poor health. On his return to the United States in 1856 he promoted a colonization scheme, whereby African Americans would settle in Nigeria. The scheme gained some support, but eventually died in the U.S. House of Representatives.
