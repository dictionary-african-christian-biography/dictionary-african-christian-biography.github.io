A Dinka Malwal, son of Akec Kwac and Alwel Agol, Barnaba Deng was born at Atokwel about 1935 and baptized at Kwajok in 1947. As a seminarian he was trained in Bussere, Gulu, and Tore River before going to Florence, Italy, where he joined the Verona Fathers in 1959. At the end of his theological course he was ordained at Milan by Cardinal Montini (who later became Pope Paul VI) on April 7, 1962. Back in the Sudan the following year he worked in the missions of Gordhiim and Aweil. Searched constantly by police, who accused him of helping the rebels, he fled to Wau where, on August 23, 1965 he was arrested and killed. His body was devoured by hyenas. Thus he sealed with his death a life of great zeal and constant dedication.
