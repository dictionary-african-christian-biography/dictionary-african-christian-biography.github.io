A Zande, born at Ndoruma about 1917, son of Tutuo and Inipayo, Angelo Igiripai Tutuo was baptized at Mupoi in 1931. He was accepted in Bussere Minor Seminary in 1933 and in Gulu Seminary in 1939. After some years of probation he was ordained, the first Zande priest, at Mupoi on October 12, 1946 by Bishop F. X. Bini of Khartoum. After some years of apostolic ministry among the Azande he retired from priestly activity in 1965. He died in Tombura in May 1980. He was district commissioner and it is suspected that he was poisoned after denouncing some illegal trading permits.
