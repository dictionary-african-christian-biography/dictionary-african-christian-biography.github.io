Ian Croudace was born in Gwelo, Rhodesia (present-day  Zimbabwe). In 1949 he became a Christian through the perseverance of his sister  who had prayed for her family for eighteen years. Ian and his brothers, David  and Mick, became active in ministry in the Christian Brethren Church. Ian married  his wife, Marilyn, in 1956. She was born in Wolverhampton, England and became a  Christian in a Congregational Church in 1949. As a girl of fifteen she was  strong in her Christian faith in spite of strong family opposition. Her family immigrated  to Rhodesia in 1952 and she met Ian the following year in 1953.

The Croudaces heard of the Nazarene Bible College in Florida, South Africa from  a Nazarene missionary in Malawi, James Graham. The couple enrolled in the Bible  College and spent three years studying there. While at the college in 1967 Ian experienced  entire sanctification and was ordained a minister in 1971 by V. H. Lewis. The  Croudaces were then sent to work in Bulawayo, Rhodesia, and felt God's leading through  their reading of Isaiah 14:1, &quot;The Lord will have compassion on Jacob...and  will settle them in their own land. Aliens will join them...&quot; Another  significant verse for them was Isaiah 42:9, &quot;See, the former things have  taken place, and new things I declare; before they spring into being I announce  them to you.&quot; Upon their arrival, they found &nbsp;less than a dozen people who were members of  the congregation and decided to close Sunday morning services and concentrate  on Sunday school with a special focus on an adult Bible class. After six months  they restarted Sunday morning worship services and in six years membership of  the small congregation had grown from just a dozen to sixty-five. Several  couples, including Mr. and Mrs. Tony Whittal, went into full-time ministry from  this congregation in Bulawayo.

In January 1982 the Croudaces went to serve in  Harare, Zimbabwe, after working in Horison, West Rand. One year late, in 1903,  they accepted a call to Claremont Church, Cape Town, South Africa. There they  worked with David and Karen Samson to merge the Claremont and Calvary Churches and  form the Covenant Church in 1985. Before retiring in 1995 the Croudaces guided  the Malvern East (Johannesburg) Church through six years of relocating to  establish the church in Primrose. The church grew during that time.
In Zimbabwe the Croudaces were involved in radio  and television ministries. Ian also had a ministry with a Christian motorcycle  organization. A colleague reported that Ian Croudace was the best church  planter in the district. By 1998 the Croudaces had moved to Durban where they  worked with the Morningside Church. Later, the couple moved to New Zealand where  Ian passed away in January 2013.
