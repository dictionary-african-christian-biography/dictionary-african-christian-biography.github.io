Ralph Edward Dodge was a Methodist missionary and bishop in Africa. Dodge was born in Terril, Iowa, and educated at Taylor University, Indiana (B.A.), Boston University (M.A.), and Hartford Seminary Foundation (S.T.M., Ph.D.). Ordained in the Methodist Episcopal Church, he served as a missionary in Angola (1936-1950), as executive secretary for Africa, Board of Missions of the Methodist Church (1950-1956), and as a bishop for Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe, 1956-1968); he was reelected bishop for life. Churches under Dodge's leadership moved from being compliant partners with colonial white rule to becoming advocates of radical social change. António Agostinho Neto, Dodge's secretary in Angola, whom he enabled to study medicine in Portugal on a Methodist Crusade scholarship, later became founder and president of the Movimento Popular de Libertação de Angola (MPLA) and of the People's Republic of Angola. Dodge's friend Eduardo Mondlane became first president of Frente de Libertação de Moçambique (FRELIMO). Among the more than 100 Zimbabweans sponsored by Dodge and the Methodist Church for overseas study was Abel Tendekai Muzorewa, his successor as bishop, who became prime minister of Rhodesia.

With passionate commitment to African majority rule in both state and church, Dodge was expelled from Rhodesia in 1964 by the lan Smith regime, but he was supported as president by the Southern Rhodesia Christian Conference and by his church. From exile in Zambia he authored *The Unpopular Missionary* (1964) and *The Pagan Church* (1968). Dodge retired in the United States in 1968.
