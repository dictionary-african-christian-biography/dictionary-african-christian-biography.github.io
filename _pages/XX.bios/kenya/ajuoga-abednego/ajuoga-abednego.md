He was educated in Church Missionary Society schools and baptized an Anglican (1943). During the 1940s he trained for a career with the railway, but was 'called' to the priesthood and attended theological college instead (1950 - 1954). He  was ordained a priest in Nairobi and then posted to Eldoret in western  Kenya.
During the mid-1950s, when the followers of the East African revival movement provoked controversy, he remained a strong advocate of unity within the established church.  Nevertheless, he clashed with his superiors and was demoted.  He responded by breaking from the Anglican Church in Africa (known as *Johera*) with a large dissident faction.  His church flourished, and by 1971 he claimed 85,000 followers and had established a network of schools.
