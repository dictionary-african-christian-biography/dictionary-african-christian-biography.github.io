Michele Stallone was born on September 10, 1921 at Giovinazzo in the province of Bari, Italy. When he was thirteen he entered the IMC (Consolata Missionaries), where he had his education and preparation for the priesthood and missionary work. He was ordained a priest on May 31, 1947. The following year he was sent to Kenya and worked in Kikuyuland for some years, until he was sent in 1953 to the new mission of Baragoi where he spent the rest of his life working as a dedicated missionary for the development of the community and of the mission. He was murdered by bandits on November 19, 1965, and was buried in Nyeri.
