He was accepted into the Consolata Missionaries (IMC) by the founder in 1917, was ordained a priest on April 1926, and became a teacher in the IMC seminaries. He left for Kenya in 1934, but during World War II he was taken to South Africa as a prisoner of war. After 1944 he returned to Kenya and until his death he worked in Meru as a teacher.
