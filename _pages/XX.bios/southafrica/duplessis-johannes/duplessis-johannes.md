Johannes Du Plessis was a South African missiologist. Du Plessis graduated from the theological seminary at the University of Stellenbosch and from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland, with a doctorate in theology (having studied briefly also in Halle, Germany). He was ordained a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) in 1894, and became general secretary for mission of that church in 1903. In this capacity he traveled on foot across sub-Saharan Africa. From 1913 to 1930 he was professor of Christian mission and later also of New Testament at Stellenbosch. In this capacity he had a strong influence on missiological thinking within the DRC.
