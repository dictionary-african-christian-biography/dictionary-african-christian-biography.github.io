![Jacobus Dibakwane](/images/bio-pics/southafrica/dibakwane-jandl/dibakwane-jacob.jpg){:class="bio"}{:height="221px" width="158px"}![Leah Dibakwane](/images/bio-pics/southafrica/dibakwane-jandl/dibakwane-leah.jpg){:class="bio"}{:height="199px" width="158px"} Jacobus Dibakwane was born at Mamelodi near Pretoria in South  Africa. When he was twelve his family moved to Hammanskraal and at the age of  eighteen he went to work in Pretoria. In 1963, Dibakwane began to attend the Saulsville  Church of the Nazarene. There, he became a Christian and within six months believed  that God spoke to him about becoming a pastor. In April 1964 he enrolled  at the Lula Schmelzenbach Memorial Nazarene Bible College at Arthurseat,  Mpumalanga, and completed a three-year course of study to become a pastor.

Leah Dibakwane (1947-) grew up at  Craigieburn in Mpumalanga and attended the local Nazarene Sunday School and Church.  She is a cousin of Orphina (Moyele) Mahlatji. At the age of eighteen she became  a Christian and soon found work at the nearby Arthurseat Mission Station where  she worked with two missionary couples during the 1960s, Paul and Margaret  Dayhoff and Jackson and Janie Phillips. During this time, Jacobus Dibakwane,  one of the Bible College students, came into her life and Leah felt from the  depths of her heart that he was the one God had chosen to be her future  husband. At the end of his  studies, Dibakwane married Leah Batsebanne Mohlabine on February 1, 1967 at  Mnombeleni (near Arthurseat).[1]

The young couple began serving a new church at Mohlakeng,  Randfontein, West Rand. For almost three years they had an average Sunday  School attendance of only about seven. After they had worked there for five  years, however, the church began to grow and develop. The Dibakwanes then spent  four years pastoring in Bloemfontein, Orange Free State, before accepting a  call to the Sweding Church (Mmabatho), Mafikeng, Northwestern Region. There they  started with twenty-eight members and after fourteen years the congregation had  grown to 170 members.

In 1982, Jacobus and members from the Mafikeng Church were in a  very bad car accident on their way to the farewell service for a missionary  family at Ganyesa, the Rogers. The van capsized after one of the rear tires was  punctured. The passengers of the van had to wait for over an hour before help  came. One woman broke both of her legs, one leg broken in three places and the  other leg broken in one place, and she had to be hospitalized for three months. Another  woman was in hospital for six weeks and received three units of blood. Yet  another woman was unconscious for several days and remained in critical condition  for an extended period of time. Several others had smaller injuries and six  were in the hospital for several days. Everyone was thankful, however, because  none of the passengers were killed in the accident and they prayed for the  recovery of the injured.[2]

In 1984, Jacobus Dibakwane, in addition to being a pastor, became the  superintendent of the Northern Cape District. This meant that he had to  supervise churches all the way to Kimberley, 240 kilometers to the southwest of  his home in Mafikeng.[3] In 1999 Dibakwane used the  film, *Jesus*, as an evangelistic tool  and reported that, &quot;People came to the church while we were preparing for  the showing and, using the 'Four Spiritual Laws', we were able to lead many of  them to the Lord, even before we showed the film. Twenty new people were  saved because of seeing the film, and 150 came to pray for assurance of  their salvation.&quot;[4]

Soon after Jacobus and Leah became married, clouds of dismay and  disappointment began to overshadow their happiness because it seemed that they  were unable to have children. They prayed to and believed that God would  provide them a miracle claiming the promise: &quot;...with God all things are  possible&quot; (Matthew 19:26). God answered their prayers when twin sons,  Alfred and George, were born after ten years of marriage. Later another  son, Jimmy, came to bless their home.[5] Unfortunately,  Alfred drowned tragically on October 22, 1994.

The Dibakwanes enjoyed their partnership in and lifetime of ministry  together as they served God both in the pastorate and in the district  superintendency. Leah also served as a district president of Nazarene World  Mission Society until 1992.[6] In 2002 Jacobus  continued to serve as district superintendent of the Northern Cape district from  their home in Mmabatho. Eleven years later, he passed away on May 12, 2013.
