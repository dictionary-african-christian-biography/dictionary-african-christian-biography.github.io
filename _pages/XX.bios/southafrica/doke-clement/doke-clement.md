Clement Doke was a South African Baptist minister.
He was a member of an outstanding family that made
a significant impact on life in southern Africa
and beyond. His father was a Baptist minister and
church leader, and Clement followed in his footsteps,
ordained by the Baptist Union of South Africa.
He spent eight years (1914-1921) with the South
African Baptist Missionary Society in Zambia (then
Northern Rhodesia), after having first trekked
there with his father in 1913 (on that trip Clement
walked over 480 kilometers). His most outstanding
contribution was in the area of linguistics. In
his early years he translated the Bible and several
hymnbooks into the logical language, Lamba. After
returning to South Africa due to ill health, he
was appointed senior lecturer in the newly established
department of Bantu studies at the University of
the Witwatersrand in 1923. He gained a doctorate
there in 1924. He became an expert on Bantu languages
and wrote many papers and books, including *Zulu-English Dictionary* and the *English-Lamba Dictionary*. Both these works are used as reference material today. Many missionaries have been made more effective in their ministry as a result of Doke's work. Doctorates were conferred on him at Rhodes University (1971) and Witwatersrand (1972). During the latter ceremony it was claimed that "no one south of the Zambesi has given the African language such service over so many fruitful years."
