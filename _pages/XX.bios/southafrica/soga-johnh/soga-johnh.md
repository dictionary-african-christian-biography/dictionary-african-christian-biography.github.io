Missionary and first Xhosa historian.

He was a son of Tiyo SOGA, the first ordained Bantu minister in South Africa.  He studied in Glasgow (1870-7), at the University of Edinburgh (1886-90), and finally at the United Presbyterian Divinity Hall (1890-3), where he was ordained.  He returned to South Africa with a Scottish wife and opened a mission station in the Mount Frere district of the present Transkei (1893-1904).  Later he replaced his brother, Dr. William Anderson Soga (d. 1916) at a station in Elliottdale.  In addition to his mission work he completed his father's translation of *Pilgrim's Progress* into Xhosa (1929) and composed numerous Xhosa hymns.  His two works on Xhosa life and history, *The South-East Bantu* (1930) and *The Ama-Xhosa* (1932), remain standard authorities on Xhosa history.  In 1936 he retired to England where he and his family were killed in a German air raid in 1941.
