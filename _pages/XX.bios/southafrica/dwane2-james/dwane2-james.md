A leader of Ethiopianism in South Africa. Born into the Xhosa royalty at Debe Nek, in the Eastern Cape, Dwane is known for his role in promoting Ethiopianism, a nationalist pan-African church movement in the late nineteenth century. He served as Methodist minister before heading up the African Methodist Episcopal Church. In 1900, he founded the Order of Ethiopia, which he affiliated with the Anglican Church of the Province of Southern Africa. The Order has continued as a quasi-independent indigenous body. Dwane eventually became its provincial, but not its bishop as he had hoped. He is renowned for his commitment to the education, evangelization, and liberation of his people.
