Cekwane was a local preacher in Himeville, Natal, in Mzimba's
Presbyterian Church of Africa, but in 1910 his congregation had a
pentecostal experience, and they formed the Church of the Light
and their headquarters were called Ekukhanyeni (Sundkler
1976:109-110). Cekwana claimed that they had broken away because
the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church in the Cape neglected
them. He had been ordained as a minister in 1910, and served as
an evangelist for 5 years before that, but had never seen the
constitution of the church, or financial reports at conferences.
They had formed the Ukukanya Mission in 1928 (NTS 1459 193/214).
