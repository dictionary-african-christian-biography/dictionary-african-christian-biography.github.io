Hans Peter Hallbeck was a Swedish-born Moravian missionary bishop in South Africa. Hallbeck was educated in Lund and taught for a few years in Gothenburg, where he came into contact with the Moravians. He was received into their fellowship in 1804. After working as a teacher in Germany and Ireland, in 1815, he became minister of the Moravian congregation in Manchester, England, and in 1817 he was sent to Gennadendaal (Gnadenthal), Cape Province, South Africa. There he became an effective, energetic, and much respected organizer, administrator, and educator. He was appointed bishop in 1836.
