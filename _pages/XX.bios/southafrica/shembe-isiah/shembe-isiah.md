![Shembe](/images/bio-pics/southafrica/shembe-isiah/shembe_isaiah0001.jpg){:class="bio"} Separatist church leader. He had no formal education.  During his youth he became famous as a visionary prophet and healer.  He was baptized into the African National Baptist Church (1906), but later broke away to found the Nazirite Baptist Church (1911).  Five years later he announced some revelations.  He established a holy village near Durban and developed into one of the most prominent Zulu figures of his time.  On his death in 1935 he was revered as a black messiah.  His son Johannes Galilee Shembe inherited leadership of his church.  Johannes - a Fort Hare College graduate - lacked his father's charisma, and had trouble maintaining his leadership.  Nevertheless, he still had 80 000 adherents in 1970.
