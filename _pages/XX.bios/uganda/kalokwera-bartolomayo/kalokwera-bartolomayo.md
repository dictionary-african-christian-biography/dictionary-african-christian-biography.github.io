[ACOLI, Clan: Koie]

Bartolomayo Kalokwera was a  married man who was baptized by the Rev. A. B. Fisher at Gulu on July 1, 1913  just after the mission was reestablished in Acoli.[1] Soon afterwards he became a church teacher, and was working at Bung&rsquo;atira in 1916.[2] From 1915 to 1920  his name appears as a preacher several times a year in the *Gulu Service Book*.[3]  He was a member of the church council. In about 1921 he caught sleeping  sickness, and this caused his death in 1923.[4]
