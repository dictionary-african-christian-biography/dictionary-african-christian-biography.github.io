[BUNYORO, Muganda]

Danieri Kamukukulu went to  Bunyoro as a church teacher in 1896 or 1897.[1] When European missionaries  arrived in 1899 he was in charge of the work at Hoima, and the Rev. A. B.  Fisher describes him as &ldquo;a little man who has been a long time at work here and  is a perfect master of the language.&rdquo;[2] He accompanied Fisher on a safari to  Kibero and Fajao.[2] He left to return to Buganda in about 1906.[3]

This biography, written by  Louise Pirouet, was included in &ldquo;Appendix A: Biographical Notes,&rdquo; on page 400 of &ldquo;The Expansion of  the Church of Uganda (N.A.C.) from Buganda into Northern and Western Uganda  between 1891 and 1914, with Special Reference to the work of African Teachers  and Evangelists&rdquo; (PhD Thesis: University of East Africa, 1968).
