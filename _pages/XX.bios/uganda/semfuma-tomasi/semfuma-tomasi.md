[BUNYORO. Muganda]

In his youth Rev. Tomasi Semfuma was a servant of Princess  Nalumansi, a sister of *Kabaka* Mutesa. In 1884 he started to learn at the  Protestant mission, and must have been baptized shortly after this since he was  made a member of the first Church Council in 1885. In May 1886 he took Ashe the  news that Nalumansi had burnt her fetishes, an action which precipitated  further persecution. He would have been executed, but Mackay redeemed him with  a gift of ivory to the *Kabaka*. In 1888 he was among the Christian exiles  in Ankole. He was commissioned by Bishop Tucker in 1891 as one of the first  lay-evangelists. In 1892 he was wounded at the Battle of Mengo, but his life  was saved by Dr. Gaskoin Wright. In 1895 he was sent as an evangelist to Koki,  and when Kitehimbwa was appointed by the British *Mukama* of Bunyoro in  1898 he went with him and stayed at Masindi teaching at his court. In 1899 he  was ordained deacon, and returned for a time to Masindi. In 1901 he was  ordained priest and was then appointed to Luwero in North Bulemezi where he  remained until 1916.[2] In that year he was transferred to Natete where he  worked until his retirement. He died at Katwe on September 4, 1929.[3]
