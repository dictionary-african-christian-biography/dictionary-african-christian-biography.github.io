[TESO]

Eriya Ocom was one of the early pupils of Ngora High School,  and its first head boy.[1] He was baptized on March 26, 1911 by the Rev. H. B.  Ladbury.[2] After completing his schooling he became a D.C.&rsquo;s interpreter, and  was then made an [illegible] chief, working first at Mukongoro and later at  Kumi. In 1920 he was one of the first group of Iteso to be made *ebuku* chiefs  and was put in charge of Usuku county.[3] Whilst at Katakwi he was visited by  Bishop Gresford Jones to whom he showed the roads he had made and the church he  had built.[4] He later was transferred to Kumi, but he died in 1927 before he  had worked there long. He remained a church-goer although he later took more  than one wife. His &ldquo;ring&rdquo; wife (wife married in church), Ludiya, who outlived  him, remained a strong Christian throughout her life.[5]
