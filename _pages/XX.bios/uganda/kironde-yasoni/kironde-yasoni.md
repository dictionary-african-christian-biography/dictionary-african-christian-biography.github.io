[TORO, ANKOLE. Muganda]

Yasoni Kironde arrived to teach  in Toro in 1899 and was first posted to Butiti and then to the small nearby  village of Myeri. In March 1901 he was sent to Butanuka and in June of the same  year was transferred to Rubona near Butiti where there had been trouble among  the teachers. In August 1901 he came to Kabarole and was reposted to Buhongo,  headquarters of the *Mukwenda*, to take charge of the work there. In each  of these places he met considerable opposition, but this seems to have been  partly because he was a Muganda. His own account of his work in Toro shows some  signs that like many Baganda he despised the Batoro, and this was a time where  there was considerable friction in Toro. Nevertheless he claimed to have built  up good congregations in each place where he worked. In 1902 he returned to  Mengo.[1] In 1911 and 1912 we find him in Ankole.[2] In 1916 he was transferred from Ndejje where he had been training teachers, to Mukono, the most important center for theological training. He was not an altogether easy member of the  staff there.[3]

**Notes**(short  form; see [List of  Sources](../pirouet-appendixa-sources/) for complete citations):
1. *Mengo Notes*. April 1902 published an account, translated into English, of an  address he had given describing his work in Toro. All the first part of this  account is based on this address. It is given partly because it is an example  of the difficulties teachers faced on account of the constant changes of  location to which they were subject.

2. *Mbarara Service Book*.

3. *Minutes of the Theological Board*: January 29 and April 5, 1916.
