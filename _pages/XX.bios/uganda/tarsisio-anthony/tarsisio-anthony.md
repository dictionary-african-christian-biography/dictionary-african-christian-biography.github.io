Tarsisio Nsobya was a religious belonging to the first indigenous Catholic religious congregation for men in Africa, "Bannakaroli [1] Brothers" (Brothers of St. Charles Lwanga, BSCL).

Tarsisio Anthony Nsobya was born to Mukasa Bazira Lubwama and Felista Mwanika Namubiru on January 11, 1927 at Kannyanda Bulamba in Bulemeezi, central Uganda. Nsobya did his primary education at Kijaguzo primary school while residing in Kiteredde with the Bannakaroli Brothers--since he intended to join them--and at Bikira primary school. He received his secondary education at St. Mary's College, Kisubi and trained as a teacher at Mt. St. Theresa Teacher's College, Kisubi. All these educational institutions are located in central Uganda.

From childhood Nsobya loved the Uganda martyrs on whom he wrote a play entitled "The Blood of the Uganda Martyrs." He also made a film about them. He was always inspired by the Uganda Martyrs and regarded them as a treasure to Uganda and Africa.

Nsobya took his first religious vows on November 21, 1947 and thereafter taught science in schools in central Uganda: St. Henry's College, Kitovu, St. Mary's College, Kisubi and St. Augustine Junior Secondary School in Bikira. Nsobya was also principal of Sacred Heart College at Kiteredde in Rakai, south central Uganda. From 1969 on Nsobya studied astronomy, physics, chemistry, and mathematics at Manhattan College in the U.S., graduating with a bachelor of science degree, as well as a certificate in applied electronics and environmental research.

Later in life, still in central Uganda, Nsobya was principal of Nyondo Teachers' College and principal at the Technical Institute Kyamaganda. From 1994 to 2000 he was superior general of the Brothers of St. Charles Lwanga (Bannakaroli Brothers).

He served the Catholic Church in Uganda in the fields of Ganda traditional culture and education. He was a proponent of African traditional culture as a tool for development. He carried out research on Buganda African cultural traditional leadership and traditional religion and ascertained the similarities with Christianity. He also promoted African Christianity in Uganda. In 1998 Nsobya was awarded a Buganda certificate of merit by Kabaka Ronald Muwenda Mutebi, the cultural traditional leader of Buganda, central Uganda, in recognition of Nsobya's development efforts in Buganda, especially in education. Nsobya was prayerful, a distinguished writer, educationist, a scientist, advocate of African traditional culture, and leader.

Nsobya always engaged in intellectual discussions and was an accomplished researcher who loved sharing knowledge with others. He traveled a lot in pursuit of knowledge. He promoted hard work, gradual accumulation of wealth, and consolidation of one's fortune in life. He believed in responsible living. Nsobya practiced all these things until he died at the ripe old age of seventy-nine after fifty-nine long years of service to humanity as a member of the congregation of St. Charles Lwanga Brothers. Nsobya lived an exemplary spiritual life that demonstrated the Christian virtues of love, hope, and charity. His years of service to others in religious life brought consolation to many.

Note:

1. "Bannakaroli" refers to the St. Charles Lwanga Brothers who are also known as the "Kiteredde" Brothers. *Banna* in Luganda--the language of the Baganda people of central Uganda--means "of." *Karoli* is the way Baganda pronounce the name Charles, hence "Bannakaroli"--the Brothers of St. Charles Lwanga, a leading Uganda catholic martyr saint who helped convert many to the Catholic faith. Kiteredde in Rakai District, south central Uganda, is the place where the Bannakaroli Brothers were founded by His Grace Archbishop Henry Streicher and Rev. Fr. Joseph Richard on December 18, 1927. The headquarters of the Bannakaroli Brothers is at Kiteredde.
