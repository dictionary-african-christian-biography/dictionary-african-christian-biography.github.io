[TORO]

Maliza  Kaboinuha came from Ngoma and was a relation of Vikitolia Kahinju and the *nyina  omukama*.[1] She was baptized on July 8, 1900 and the following year  volunteered to be a teacher and was trained by Miss Pike.[2] She received her  teacher&rsquo;s letter in 1902 and was sent to Kitagwenda. During the next few years  she served at Kitagweta, Butanuka, Karujumba in Busongora, and Butiti where she  worked from 1906 for several years. In 1914-1915 she was working at Ngoma, and  she then spent a further two years in Kitagwenda. She taught at Bukana and  Kabarole until in 1920 she resigned [3] and died at Ngoma three years later.[4]
