[MUGANDA]

Before Rev. Zakariya Kisingiri Kizito joined the Anglican  Mission about 1882 he had been a *mutongole* at Kyango in Buddu. He was  not baptized until December 1883 because he had a number of wives, and would  not at first give up all but one. During the persecutions of 1885-1886 he was  made a member of the first church council formed so that the church might  survive even if the missionaries had to leave. In 1888-1889 when the Christians  came to power, he was made *kagoro*, an important sub-chief in Buddu. In  1891 he was one of the first group licensed by Bishop Tucker as  lay-evangelists.[1] The same year he accompanied Captain Lugard of the Imperial  British East Africa Company on his march to the west, and he was instrumental  in bringing to Lugard&rsquo;s notice [Yafeti Byakweyamba](byakweyamba_yafeti.html) and Kasagama, whom Lugard made *Mukama* of Toro.[2] In 1892 Kizito was made *Kangao* of Bulemezi, thus achieving a  senior chieftaincy.[3] The following year he was among the first group of  Anglicans to be ordained a perpetual deacon.[4] When Kasagama was baptized in  1896, Kizito was his godfather, and the following year he visited Toro on a  semi-diplomatic, semi-pastoral mission, baptizing a number of people and performing  several marriages.[5] Later in 1897 when Mwanga was deposed, Kizito was  appointed one of the three regents of Daudi Chwa. In 1899 he was one of the  leading Baganda to become concerned that the *Mugabe *of Ankole should  accept Christian teachers, and his visit to the *mugabe* seems to have  been a turning point in getting teachers accepted.[6] After 1900 he had little  time for church affairs, but he continued to sit on the Diocesan Council until  his death in 1917.[7]

This biography, written by Louise Pirouet, was included in &ldquo;Appendix A: Biographical Notes,&rdquo;  on pages 407-8 of &ldquo;The  Expansion of the Church of Uganda (N.A.C.) from Buganda into Northern and  Western Uganda between 1891 and 1914, with Special Reference to the work of African  Teachers and Evangelists&rdquo; (PhD Thesis: University of East Africa, 1968).  Pirouet published this thesis as *Black  Evangelists* (London: Rex Collings, 1978). However, *Black  Evangelists* does not reproduce the detailed biographies, complete with  references to sources, found in Appendix A of the thesis.
