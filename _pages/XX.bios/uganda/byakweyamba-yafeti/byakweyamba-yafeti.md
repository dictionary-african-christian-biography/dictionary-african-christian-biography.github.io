[TORO, Clan: Mubito]

Yafeti Byakweyamba was the Uncle of Daudi Kasagama and  related to Kabarega. As a child he had been taken from Toro by the Baganda  armies and brought up as a *mugalagala* in Lubiri. Here he was made  responsible for some of the *kabaka*&rsquo;s women and was rewarded with the  chieftaincy of Kitanda in Buddu. Here he was taught Christianity by Petero  Nsubuga.[1] By 1891 he had already been baptized when [Zakariya Kizito Kisingiri](kizito_zakaryia_kisingiri2.html),  a more senior chief in Buddu, introduced him to Lugard with Kasagama. Lugard  decided that it would fit in well with his plans to reinstate Kasagama in Toro.  There Byakweyamba became jealous of the power of Kasagama and first challenged  him by building a more elaborate enclosure. He was then sent to Mwenge as *saza* chief and made his headquarters near Fort Lorne.[2] He was there attacked by  Kabarega&rsquo;s armies and with his Baganda followers was driven into the  forests.[3] In 1894 he and Kasagama sent to Mengo for teachers, and Petero  Nsubuga and three others answered the call. Nsubuga seems to have stayed at  Butiti and taught Byakweyamba&rsquo;s Baganda followers.[4] His jealousy of Kasagama  increased and tried to set himself up as an independent *Mukama* of Mwenge  and Kyaka. He had a violent quarrel with Kasagama and was reproved by  Ashburnham.[5] In 1895 he was sent to Kampala in connection with the trouble  between Kasagama and the administration, returning in 1896.[6] In 1897 he went  back to Senda in Buddu where he had lands, and being disappointed in his  ambitions, and increasingly troubled by a lame leg, he committed suicide  there.[7]
