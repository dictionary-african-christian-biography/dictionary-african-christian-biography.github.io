[BUNYORO, Clan: Numooli]

Paulo Byabaowezi was the son of Nyakamatura, son of  Nyakatura, and a hereditary *mujwarakondo*, his chieftaincy of Bugahya  being the foremost in Bunyoro.[1] When Kabarega fled to Lango in 1894 he  appointed Byabaowezi as his *musigire* in Bugahya.[2] In the same year he  was defeated twice in battle, once at Musaijamakuru, and later at Mparo with  three other of Kabarega&rsquo;s generals.[3] He therefore made what terms he could  with the British, and so retained his chieftaincy. It was to his headquarters  that the first Christian teachers, invited through the agency of [Mika Fataki](fataki_mika.html), lived  and worked, though is attitude towards them was at first ambiguous. He met  Fisher when he visited in 1895, and Fisher greatly liked him.[4] By this time  Fisher arrived in Bunyoro permanently in 1899 he was the leader of those who  were under instruction near Hoima, and he was baptized in October 1899. Shortly  afterwards he married Damari Karujuka, a *mubitokati* (princess) who had  been interested in Christianity from the beginning.[5] During 1899 and 1900 he  was quarreling with Rwabudongo, the head of the *barusura*, for supremacy,  and he took to himself honors which should have been the prerogative of the *mukama* only.[6] He had been appointed one of Kitehimbwa&rsquo;s regents, but relations with  the *mukama* were strained and Byabaowezi&rsquo;s power was the greater.[7] He  did not altogether lose his ambitions when Duhaga was appointed *mukama* in Kitehimbwa&rsquo;s place, and during the *Nyangire* rising of 1907 he called  the *mukama*&rsquo;s position in question and sought high honor for himself.[8]  The missionaries were somewhat at a loss to know what to make of him, for they  could not square his ambition and participation in *Nyangire* with his  staunch support of the church, and they thought his wife was a better Christian  than he was.[9] At the opening of the new church in Hoima in 1908, he, together  with Jomusi Miti and the m*ukama*, were singled out and thanked for the  help that they had given in the building of the church.[10] He died suddenly in  1912, and had it not been for the support of [Mika Fataki](fataki_mika.html), his sons might have been passed  over and lost their father&rsquo;s chieftaincy. He was one of those who took readily  to new ways, and in this he may be compared with Nuwa Mbaguta of Ankole and  Apolo Kagwa of Buganda.
