Christian separatist leader; founder of the Malakite Church.

He was educated by Anglican missionaries but failed their baptismal test twice (1901 & 1904).  After working as a school teacher and petty government chief, he helped to found a separatist revival movement in 1914 which emphasized rejection of European medical techniques.  The movement developed into a  formal church, 'The Society of the One Almighty God', or the  Malakite Church.  His followers were called *Bamalaki*, or Malakites.  By the early 1920s he claimed over 90 000 followers.  Eventually the church was suppressed by the colonial government when it opposed a vaccination programme.  Malaki himself died in a hunger strike.
