[ACOLI, Clan: Pugwinyi, Patiko]

Muca Ali was the son of Gimoro, a man well-known to Sir Samuel Baker.[1]  Was baptized at Keyo by the Rev. A. L. Kitching on November 26, 1906, and was  one of the first three converts in Acoli.[2] He had been converted as a result  of the preaching of Yohana Murusura, a Munyoro evangelist. He already had two  wives and before his baptism he sent away his second wife who had borne his  only child, Andereya Aluku, and for this his clan was very angry with him, and  he took refuge at the mission.[3] When the mission was temporarily abandoned in  1908 he kept the handful of Acoli Christians together.[4] There was further  conflict with his clan when he refused to build an *abila* (spirit shrine)  in his homestead, and instead began to build a church. For this he was badly  beaten up.[5] In 1909 when teacher were sent from Bunyoro he welcomed them and  introduced them to Acoli life. In 1911 and 1912 he taught in Lango.[6] In 1913  when the mission was reestablished near Gulu he moved his home to the new site  and lived near the church.[7] In 1921 and 1923 he taught in Kitgum.[8] With [Sira Dongo](dongo_sira.html) he  preached and visited churches throughout Lango and Acoli.[9] He died suddenly  in February 1929 just before he was to have been ordained deacon.[10]
