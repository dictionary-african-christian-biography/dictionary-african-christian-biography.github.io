It has been in preparation over a number of years, and the  selection of topics for inclusion has proved extremely difficult. The longer  one spends on a work of this sort, the longer grows the list of topics one  wishes to include. But in view of the amount of research needed for each, one  has to call a halt, since in the present situation, which is characterized by a  lack of textbooks and teaching materials, the most pressing need is for some  information to be circulated, and this Dictionary has been held up long enough.  It is certain that every user will have complaints about omissions. The only  answer I have to give to these complaints is that my own list of the topics I  should like to have included is probably longer than anyone else's.

Since the Dictionary began to be prepared, both the Catholic  and Anglican Churches in Uganda have several times altered their dioceses, and  some reflection of this will be found here. It is hoped that cross-referencing  will adequately cover the present situation.

Some mention must be made of the sources on which the  information here is based.

The information about Anglican clergy has been checked with __A  Register of Missionaries and Native Clergy, 1805-1905__ (published by the  C.M.S. for private circulation), and with the relevant __issues of Crockford's  Clerical Directory*.*__ The dates of  ordination of Ugandan clergy have been checked with the Registers of Oaths and  Declarations taken by clergy on ordination for the Dioceses of Eastern  Equatorial Africa and Uganda.

Much of the information on African Christian leaders,  Anglican and Catholic, derives from research undertaken in preparing a Ph.D.  thesis for the University of East Africa. It rests on information in the  Archives of the C.M.S.; from parish registers, account books and minutes books;  from a wide variety of printed sources; and from a large number of oral  interviews. This last has been checked with documentary material wherever  appropriate, and with other oral sources.

Material for the Catholic Church has been derived from the  sources mentioned below in the list of contributors to whom special thanks are  due; from printed and published sources; and from oral information. Wherever  appropriate, material has been checked with the __Catholic Directory for  Eastern Africa__, editions of 1965 and 1968/9.

The printed sources are too numerous to be listed here, but  may be found in __A Bibliography of African Church History__, circulated by  the Department of Religious Studies, and available on request.

In spite of careful checking it is inevitable that some  errors will have crept in, and the editor will be grateful if those who noticed  them will be kind enough to write and tell her.

Special mention must be made of a number of people who have  helped with a series of articles, or given facilities without which this work  could not have been done. Thanks are due to:

Many others have helped in the compilation of the  Dictionary, supplying information which they have often kindly allowed me to  redraft so as to achieve some sort of uniformity of treatment. Information  about institutions has normally been supplied by a member of staff of the  institution. A complete list of these contributors will be found at the end.  But for all errors, and for the point of view expressed, the editor alone is  responsible.
