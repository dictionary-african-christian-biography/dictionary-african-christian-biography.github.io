[ACOLI, Clan: Kai, Koie]

Muca Kibwola was the son of *Ewot* Lagony of Koie. He was one of the chief&rsquo;s sons sent to live with the  missionaries and receive education during the first period of the mission&rsquo;s  work in Acoli.[1] He was baptized on January 5, 1908 a few days before the  missionaries left.[2] In 1911 Tegart found him working as a teacher although he  had had no training, and his children were baptized at this time.[3] He then  went to teach at Kubuze and Aduku in Lango, but died there after a short  period, and an outsider succeeded as *Ewot* of Koie.[4]
