Bazilio Lumu was one of the first modern  indigenous African Catholic priests. There had been a handful of African  Catholic priests in the Christian Kingdom of Kongo in the 16th century but this priesthood soon died out. In the 19th century, a few African priests were ordained  but this  small collection of priests belonged to missionary groups. The African Church had to  wait until June 29, 1913 for Victoro Mukasa Womeraka and Bazilio Lumu to be  ordained as diocesan priests by Bishop Henri Streicher, Vicar Apostolic of  Northern Nyanza, Uganda.

Lumu  was born in the  Bukalagi area of Uganda around 1875 to Mr. Wamala of the *Ndiga* (Sheep) clan. His mother&rsquo;s name  remains unknown. Both parents died when Lumu was still very young. Lumu was  baptized at Lubaga on September 8, 1891. One year later, in 1892, he migrated to  Buddu with his relatives and several Catholics because of  the war of 1892. Before he moved to Villa Maria at the end of 1892, Lumu  attended the mission school at Kampungu. There, he was presented to the Fathers  and sponsored in his education by Chief Alex Ssebowa, the Pokino of Buddu. Lumu  regarded Ssebowa as his father throughout his life. In January 1893, he matriculated  at the new seminary in Villa Maria. In the new seminary, there were 33 candidates but only  Lumu was destined to become a priest. The rest served both  the church and the state in many vital sectors. They eventually sent several of  their sons to the seminary and many of them eventually became priests.

On  October 13, 1903, Bazilio Lumu was admitted to the major seminary along with  five others: Adriano Mukasa, Andrea Namusanga, Teodoro Tibazalika, Vitoro  Katula and Victoro Mukasa Womeraka. These six men were the first major  seminarians in Uganda and of them only Lumu and Womeraka became priests. After  his admission to the major seminary, Lumu underwent rigorous training at  Kisubi, Bikira, Bukalasa and Katigondo seminaries in Latin and in the philosophy and theology courses that were customary for a candidate for the  Catholic priesthood. Lumu and Womeraka underwent two years of probation from  1908 to 1910 at Nandere and Villa Maria. On Christmas Eve 1911 they were ordained  subdeacon and the following Christmas, in 1912, deacon. Their ordination to the priesthood  at Villa Maria on June 29, 1913 drew an estimated fifteen thousand people, the  largest crowd ever seen in the Ganda kingdom up to that date. Louise Pirouet observed, &quot;This  ordination was an event of immense significance for the Catholic Church in  Uganda and elsewhere in Africa.&quot; Henceforward, the success of the Major Seminary  and the future of the Catholic Church in Uganda were on secure ground.

Bazilio Lumu&rsquo;s first appointment was at Bukalasa Minor Seminary together with  his brother priest Victoro Mukasa Womeraka. Lumu remained there until 1918  where he taught his students with great care and enthusiasm. He was a scholar  who  always encouraged his students to  study hard and to stay up to date. Lumu also got involved in gardening in order  to encourage healthy eating among seminarians and staff. In 1918,  Lumu left  the minor seminary because he was sent to the parishes. He served in Mitala Maria, Narozari, Nazareti, Kitovu and Villa Maria.

The  people in these parishes remember Bazilio Lumu for many things. He was  dignified and stately and walked with the nobility of chiefs. This was not  surprising since he was brought up by Chief Alex Ssebowa. Yet, people also  remember him as a very kind person and those who came to understand him better loved him more.

People  also remember that Lumu was extraordinarily clean and very orderly. Fr. Brother  Anatoli Wasswa put it this way, *&ldquo;Ebyambalo  bye bulijjo nga bitukula nnyo, enju ye bulijjo nga nyonjo nnyo. Ebintu bye  bulijjo nga biterevu&rdquo;* (his vestments were always very clean, his house was  always very clean and everything of his was always in order). Lumu had very  beautiful handwriting, which is evident in the baptismal and marriage  registers. He did all this with a very orderly mind and in an organized fashion.

Lumu loved learning and in his free time he studied and did research. He  managed to teach himself new things including languages like English and  French. Lumu also wanted to be informed on many issues and always sought to be  up to date in his studies. He understood perfectly well that an ignorant priest  is  actually very dangerous both to himself and the people of God put in  his care.

John Mary Waliggo observed that many people remembered Lumu as a kind,  charitable, and loving priest who spent most of his energy and time preaching,  teaching, and visiting people. He dedicated himself to paying school fees for  children and supporting them in schools. Lumu was poor yet very charitable and  in all his pastoral visits he would identify those who had the greatest need  and once in a while, as his means could allow, he would take them a kilo of  sugar, salt, and soap. He also loved the priesthood and the priestly  brotherhood. He cherished his brother priests and made sure they were well fed.  He hated seeing his fellow priests eat poorly.

Lumu was a very industrious and hardworking person, always sickly but  available, committed and dedicated to his work. He paid attention to his duties as a priest which he fulfilled meticulously. He was exceptionally  prayerful and loved manual labor as well. However, in his later years, he gradually got weak. This  began when he first got serious itching all over his body, then he got  jaundice. His knees began to exude water and he died on March 3, 1946. Lumu  was buried with great honor and dignity at Bukalasa. Later, his body was  transferred to Villa Maria Cathedral.

While many people mourned his death, the majority of people were happy that Lumu had died a priest. He had fought a good fight. From that point forward, the people  had  an ancestor in the African priesthood. He had been ordained a priest in  1913, had worked as priest, and had died as a priest in good standing. People knew  where his grave was and so they could swear by him. Even in his death, Bazilio Lumu remains a  hero: the first modern African priest and the first modern African ancestor.
