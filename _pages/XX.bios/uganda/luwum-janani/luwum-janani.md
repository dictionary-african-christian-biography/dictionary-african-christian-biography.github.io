Archbishop Janani Luwum, an Anglican archbishop and martyr, was an implacable foe of Idi AMIN, who had him murdered.

From 1956 Luwum worked as a parish priest.  He was elected bishop of northern Uganda in 1969, and in 1974 he was chosen archbishop of Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and Boga-Za√Øre.  He confronted the injustices and atrocities of the Amin regime almost immediately, at first with private remonstrances and finally in a radio address at Christmas in 1976.  The sermon was censored before he completed it.  Luwum threatened a public demonstration, and for a time he united Catholics and Protestants behind him - a major feat in religiously diverse Uganda.

Amin reacted swiftly and without mercy, sacking Luwum's home.  The Anglican bishops responded with a stinging denunciation of Amin's abuses.  Luwum was detained and questioned by Amin personally.  Two days later Luwum was publicly accused of sedition and arms smuggling while participating in a large public rally in Kampala.  This event provided an excuse for a second arrest, and by the end of the day Luwum was dead.  The cause of death was listed as a car crash, but it was later revealed that Luwum, along with two government ministers, had been shot on orders from Amin.  Luwum was accepted immediately as a hero of resistance to tyranny, and there have been efforts by the Anglican Church to recognize him as a saint.
