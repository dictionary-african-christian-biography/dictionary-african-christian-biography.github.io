[TORO]

Paulo Byabusakuzi was born at Katwe, Busongora. When Lugard  passed through in 1891 he was taken from his parents by one of Lugard&rsquo;s  followers and brought to Butanuka. Later he was sold to a man called Mufumu. He  first started to receive Christian instruction at Butanuka from a teacher  called Enoka Wanjara, where the chief was Yosua Lusoke, *katikiro* until  1897 or 1899. He was baptized in July 1900 and confirmed the same year. In 1901  he became a teacher and was sent to Bubandi with a Muganda, but the Muganda did  not stay long, and he was left to carry on alone. In 1902 he returned to  Kabarole and did some training under the Rev. Apolo Kivebulaya, and later  worked with Kivebulaya for a year in Buruli. In 1906 he married Sofu Kihangwa,  also a trained teacher. He did his first letter in 1907 and his second letter  in 1913, and after this, went to Ankole for a year. From 1918 onwards he taught  at Kabarole for several years, and later did his third letter at Mukono, but  was not considered suitable for ordination, largely because of his age. In 1966  he was still teaching at Kamengo near Kabarole. He is the father of the late  Timothy Bazurbaza.
