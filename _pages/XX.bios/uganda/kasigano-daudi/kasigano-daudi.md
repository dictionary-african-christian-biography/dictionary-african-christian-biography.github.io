[ANKOLE]

Daudi Kasigano was the son of Kaihura, chief  of Bunyaruguru, an almost independent principality until the advent of British  rule, although paying tribute to the *Mugabe* of Ankole. On Kaihura&rsquo;s  death in 1901 Kasigano succeeded him, becoming *saza* chief.[1] He was  baptized on July 14, 1903, and it was hoped that with a Christian chief, the  encouraging work at Kasinga would really prosper. (Kaihura had put many  obstacles in the way of his people learning[2]). However, he got into trouble  with the British for becoming involved with the Belgians in frontier  disputes.[3] When one of the *Mugabe*&rsquo;s *askaris* was killed in 1906  he fled to Belgian territory and was dismissed. For a while the *saza* was  put under Mbaguta.[4] In 1907 he seems to have returned, for when the people of  Bunyaruguru rose in revolt against the Baganda chiefs who were abusing their  power, he was leader of the revolt.[5] He then lived in Toro for many years,  returning to live near Kyagaju about 1920, but taking no active part in  affairs.[6]
