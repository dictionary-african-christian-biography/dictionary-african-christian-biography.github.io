[ALUR/JANAN]

Matayo Ademola was born at Nebbi in what is now the West Nile  District.[1] Was taken to Bunyoro after fighting between the Alur and  Kabarega&rsquo;s armies. He found himself in danger of being sacrificed, and went to  the government officer at Masindi, who sent him to the Rev. A. B. Lloyd, whose  household he joined.[2] In 1903 and 1904 he accompanied Lloyd to Acoli, and the  second time he remained there as an interpreter, Alur and Acoli being mutually  intelligible.[3] He was baptized by the Rev. A. E. Pleydell at Keyo on May 27,  1906.[4] When the mission was temporarily closed in 1908 he left with the  missionaries, but returned again after a year or two, and when the CMS returned  in 1913 he was found living near the present church. In 1914 he was appointed *jago* (sub-chief) in charge of the Jonam who had been moved to Minakulu because of  sleeping sickness. He remained a chief until his death.[5]
