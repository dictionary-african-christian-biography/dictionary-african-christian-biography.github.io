Petero Bikumya was born at Bugoma and baptized there.[1] In  1903 he went to Burega as a teacher and stayed there for about two years.[2] In  1907 he was appointed sub-chief at Bugoma in succession to [Daudi Bitatule](bitatule_daudi.html). He  preached regularly in the church.[3] On the death of [Paulo Byabaowezi](byabaowezi_paulo_and_damari_karujuka.html) in 1912 he was  appointed regent to one of his sons, Zakayo Jawe. In 1917 he was made *katikiro* of Bunyoro. He was the author of *Ky&rsquo;Abakama ba Bunyoro* published in  1927. He was given awards both by the Bunyoro Kingdom Government and the  Protectorate Government for his services as *katikiro*, and was awarded  the M.B.E. He died on October 2, 1939.
