Joseph Kiwanuka was the first African Catholic bishop in modern times. He was born in Buganda just as its religious wars were ending and British rule became established. Raised a Catholic, he was educated in Bukalasa and Katigondo seminaries and was ordained in 1929. Selected for further study in Rome, where he became the first African Doctor of Canon Law, he then joined the White Fathers missionary society. In 1939 he was chosen as first vicar apostolic of Masaka and consecrated bishop by Pius XII I Rome. Twenty years later he became archbishop of Kampala, attended Vatican II and died just after it ended.

Kiwanuka was the first black diocesan bishop in any mainline
church since [Samuel
Crowther's]({{site.url}}/stories/nigeria/crowther5-samuel/) death in 1891. For 12 years he remained the
only African bishop in the Catholic Church, apart from those
in Madagascar and Ethiopia. Masaka, wholly staffed by local
priests, was seen as an experiment, one often criticized by
missionaries. In fact, however, Kiwanuka's achievement was
outstanding. His development of elected lay parish councils
and parents' associations for church schools went far ahead
of current Catholic practice as did his regular dispatch of
priests abroad for further studies. His political influence
was extensive. In such ways Kiwanuka pioneered the African
church of the next generation.
