[TORO]

Vikitoliya Kahinju was the *nyina  omukama* (queen mother) of *Mukama* Daudi Kasagama. When Toro was  invaded by Bunyoro in 1876[1] she fled with three of her children to Ankole.  She was sheltered on route by the Bakonjo at Nyagwaki. In Ankole she was given  refuge at the court of Ntare V, but Kabarega sent to have her children killed,  and two of them were put to death. She escaped to Buganda with the third child  and he was brought up with Byakweyamba.[2] She returned to Toro when Lugard  reestablished the kingdom of Toro under Kasagama. She became one of the first  to embrace Christianity and was baptized on May 8, 1896.[3] She then asked that  Christian teachers should be sent to Nyagwaki to show her gratitude to the  Bakonjo there who had sheltered her on her flight to Ankole. Her enclosure was  at Ngoma, about a mile and a half from Fort Portal, and this quickly became a  church center. She encouraged all the members of her household to become  Christians, and punished those who did not go to church.[5] Several of her  retinue became teachers.[6]
