One of the first two Ugandan Catholic priests. He was born in Mawokota in Buganda, and was a member of the Ndiga (sheep) clan, his father's name being Wamala. He was baptized at Rubaga on September 8, 1891. He first went to school at Bikira, and in 1892 went to Villa Mario and joined the newly-founded seminary. Here he studied until in 1913 he was ordained priest by Bishop Streicher, and, together with Fr. (now the Very Rev. Msgr.) Victor Womereka Mukasa, became the first Ugandan to be ordained to the priesthood. For five years after his ordination he worked at Bukalasa Seminary with Fr. Mukasa, and from 1918 onwards worked as a parish priest at Mitala-Maria, Narozari, Nazareth, Kitovu, and Villa Maria where he died.
