[TORO, Clan: [illegible]]

Petero Tigwezire was born about 1875 during the reign of  Kyaika when Kabarega was Mukama of Bunyoro.[1] His father was Katorogo and his  grandfather Kabwa. Kabwa&rsquo;s original home was at Misenyi in Mwenge and he had  come to Toro with Prince Kaboyo when the latter rebelled against his father. He  was made a chief at Bulyambuzi, and Tigwezire was born there. His father&rsquo;s  title was *Sekibobo Omuhukya* and this was a hereditary chieftaincy.[2]  Tigwezire succeeded to this chieftaincy at the age of fourteen. He was baptized  by Callis in the Mpanga River, and soon afterwards was made *saza* chief  of Bwamba with the title of *Kasuju*.[3] He also worked as a church  teacher and built churches in Bwamba. In 1896 he was elected to the Kabarole  Church Council, and in the same year married Miriya Mutakyanga.[4] She had been  one of Kasagama&rsquo;s wives, and was baptized on May 8, 1896.[5] She received her  letter as a church teacher in 1902 and taught for four years.[6] In 1901 Petero  was confined to his Bwamba chieftaincy, and the same year accompanied Kasagama  on a visit to Bunyoro.[7] Later he served as a *saza* chief in Kabale and  then in Mwenge. He would like to have been ordained, but was rejected because  he would not entirely give up drink.[8] He was one of the leading Christians in  Toro and was well-known for his kindness in looking after widows and orphans.  He died on December 31, 1918.
