[ACOLI, (Alur)]

Rev. Canon Sira Dongo was born near Ang&rsquo;uzzi in what is now  the Democratic Republic of the Congo. His father was named Anywalo To, and his  mother died in a small pox epidemic when he was a child. With his sisters he  was captured by Kabarega&rsquo;s *barusura* and taken to Bunyoro. Here he became  a gun-bearer to one of the *barusura*. His master owed a debt of ten guns  to a Muganda, and when he could not pay, he handed over Dongo. In Buganda Dongo  went to church services with his master, and started to learn to read. In 1901  his master accompanied Jamusi Miti to Bunyoro on his appointment to a *saza* chieftaincy there. Dongo here took or was given his freedom, and went to serve  the CMS missionary, the Rev. H. Farthing, and continued with his baptism  classes. In 1902 before his baptism he returned to Alur country with Edwudi  Sururu, a fellow Alur also living in Bunyoro, to see his father. His clan were  angry when he insisted on returning to Bunyoro to go on with his reading. He  was baptized by the Rev. Nuwa Nakiwafu at Hoima on May 3, 1903. The same year  he accompanied the Rev. A. B. Lloyd on his exploratory safari to Acoli, acting  as an interpreter, and the following year returned as a teacher. He also helped  with the initial stages of translating St. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel into Acoli, since he  was able to work from the Luganda Bible. In 1905 he married Luoira Farwenyo,  also an Alur, who took the name Karungi when she became a Christian, and the  same year took his first letter. For a year he taught in Acoli again, and in  1907 was confirmed at Musindi. When the mission was closed in 1908 he left  Acoli with the missionaries, but after taking his second letter in 1909 he  returned to Acoli where he met with some opposition as he tried to build a  little church and start Christian teaching again. He also tried in vain to  prevent a clan fight, fighting having broken out again with the withdrawal of  the administrative post from Keyo. He did a lot to win back the confidence of  the people, but in 1911 he was recalled to be head teacher at Masindi, this  presumably being considered a more important post. However, he did not get on  with the Rev. H. W. Tegart who was a somewhat autocratic person, and in disgust  gave up his teaching and went to trade in Kitgum where he was offered a much  more lucrative job as a clerk, but his wife persuaded him to return to the  service of the church. Between 1911 and 1913 he several times visited Acoli and  larger congregations than usual turned up to hear him preach when he did so. In  1914 he passed his third letter, and from 1915-1917 he was at Mukono studying  for ordination. He was ordained deacon in 1917 and priest in 1919, and spent all  the remainder of his life working in Acoli and Lango. He was a great friend of [Muca Ali](ali_muca.html) and the two  worked together traveling around the country and preaching and teaching. In  1925 he paid a special visit to Lango with Paulo Baguma and the following year  helped Canon Lawrence open the first CMS station at Boroboro near Lira. In 1936  he was made a Canon of the Upper Nile Diocese, and died two years later.

**Notes**(short  form; see [List of  Sources](../pirouet-appendixa-sources/) for complete citations):

Based on the booklet written by Canon Lawrence entitled *Kwo pa Ladit Canon Sira Dongo*, but  corrected at a number of points, particularly with regard to his early life, by  reference to the *Baptism* and *Marriage Registers*, and from oral  information from his wife and from Canon Alipayo Latigo who made a study of his  life. See also pp. 277-9 of Chapter V and notes thereon [in Pirouet&rsquo;s thesis,  noted below].
