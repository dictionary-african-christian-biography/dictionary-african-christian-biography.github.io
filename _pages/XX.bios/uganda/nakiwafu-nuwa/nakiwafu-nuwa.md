[TORO, BUNYORO,  ANKOLE. Clan: Nyonyi. Muganda]

Rev. Nuwa Nakiwafu's father was a well-known priest of the  traditional religion at Kabaka Mwanga&rsquo;s court, and Nakiwafu and his brother  would go round with charms. After he had heard of the Christian God he became  unhappy about this. He secretly got hold of a copy of *St. Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel* in Kiswahili printed by Mackay, learned to read it and was converted to  Christianity.[1] About 1893-1894 he was working with the Rev. A. B. Fisher in  Singo.[2] In 1894 he was one of the first evangelists to go to Toro, and here  he became a favorite of Kasagama and [Hana Kageye](kageye_hana.html), and these taught him Rutoro. He  remained in Toro until 1897 when he seems to have returned to Namirembe.[3] On  May 28, 1899 he was ordained deacon by Bishop Tucker, and he was then sent to  Bunyoro where he at first worked with [Tomasi Semfuma](semfuma_tomasi.html). On January 23, 1901 he was  ordained priest and was put in charge of the work at Hoima. He remained in Bunyoro  until 1912 when the first Bunyoro were ordained priest, and were able to take  over from him.[4] From 1912-1914 he worked at Ndeje, and then moved to  Namirembe. In 1917 he spent a year at Mbarara in Ankole. From 1918 until his  retirement in 1930 he worked at [illegible].[5]
