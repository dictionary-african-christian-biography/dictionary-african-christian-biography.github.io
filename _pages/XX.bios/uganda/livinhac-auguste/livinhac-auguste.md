Auguste Simon Léon Livinhac was a superior general of the
Missionaries of Africa (or White Fathers [WF]). Born in Ginals,
Sévérac, Aveyron, France, he left the major seminary of the
diocese of Rodez to join the WF recently established by [Charles
Allemand Lavigerie]({{site.url}}/stories/algeria/lavigerie-charles2/), archbishop of Algeria. Ordained a
priest in 1873, he dedicated himself to the African mission
in 1874. In 1878 he was chosen to head the first group of
ten missionaries going to Equatorial Africa. They left North
Africa on Easter Day, April 21, 1878, and arrived in Uganda
on February 17, 1879. Studying Ruganda, he composed a grammar
and a dictionary. Ordained a bishop in 1884, he returned as
apostolic vicar to Uganda in 1885 at the height of religious
persecutions there. Several of the Ugandan Catholic martyrs
killed in 1886 had been baptized by him. With a group of Ugandans,
he attended the International Antislavery Conference in Paris
(1890). The same year he was appointed vicar general of the
WF, and after Lavigerie's death in 1892, he was chosen to
be superior general. His poor health and his continuous reappointments
as superior general (1894-1912) never allowed him to return
to Uganda. When he resigned as superior general in 1920, he
organized the documentation that would lead to the beatification
of the martyrs of Uganda. During his term of office the three
equatorial vicariates in Africa grew into nine equatorial
vicariates, two Sudanese ones, and two apostolic prefectures.
The WF grew from 233 to 930 members. It established itself
in Germany (1894), Argentina (1898), Canada (1901), Belgium
(1902), Switzerland (1911), Great Britain (1912), and the
Netherlands (1917).
