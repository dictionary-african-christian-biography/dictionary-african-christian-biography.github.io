[BUGANDA, TORO,  ANKOLE. Muhima]

As a small child, Rev. Aloni Muyinda was captured in war  from Ankole, and taken to Buganda where he grew up.[1] He joined the household  of the Rev. G. Baskerville, became a teacher, and was put in charge of the  district around Koja. He married a Munyoro, Yokobezi. In June 1900 he was  ordained deacon and posted to Ngogwe in place of Silasi Aliwonya. In August  1900 he visited Ankole, and was present when Mbaguta burnt his charms. He  remained at Ngogwe until 1903 when he was sent to Toro.[2] From July to  September 1903 he was at Butazuka and was then sent to Butiti to be under a  European.[3] Probably this was as a result of a difference of opinion over the  baptism of children not born in Christian wedlock.[4] In 1910 he was sent to  Ankole.[5] He there found that his parents had both died, but members of his  clan were still living, and he claimed his father&rsquo;s possessions.[6] In 1921 he  was ordained priest and transferred from Mbarara to Itojo where he was a good  pastor.[7] When his first wife died he married Eva Kokorokonya, a Mubito.[8] In  1927 he became a Seventh Day Adventist, and died some years later in  Rwangara.[9]
