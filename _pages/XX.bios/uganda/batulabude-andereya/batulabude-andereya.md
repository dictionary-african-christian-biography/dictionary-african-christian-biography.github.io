Uganda

[Bukedi, Muganda]

Rev. Andereya Batulabude was originally a slave from Buvuma  who became a client of Semei Kakungulu when the latter was *kimbugwe*. He  continued as his follower in Bugerere.[1] In 1901 he was ordained deacon.[2] He  pioneered the work in Bugwere at Nabowa, and then went with Kakungulu to  Budaka, and in 1904 to Mbale.[3] From 1904-1908 he was at Kumi where he worked  in close cooperation with Isaka Nsige the *saza* chief, and where he  baptized a few Iteso, but most of his work was among the Baganda.[4] In 1906 he  moved to Ngora when the mission was opened there.[5] In 1911 he was ordained  priest. In 1929 he was unfrocked, women being his undoing.[6] He later joined  the African Orthodox Church started by Reuben Spartas, but was dismissed after  only a year. He later asked to be readmitted to the Anglican Church. He died in  1935.[7]
