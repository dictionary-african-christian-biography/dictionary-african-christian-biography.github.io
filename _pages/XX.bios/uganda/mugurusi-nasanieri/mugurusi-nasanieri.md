[TORO]

Nasanieri Mugurusi was a Mwiru who had shared the exile in  Ankole after Kabarega&rsquo;s attack of 1876, when Kasagama&rsquo;s mother was forced to  flee with her children. He was renowned for his courage in fighting the  Banyoro, and known as a lion-killer. Because of this, he could get anything he  wanted. He was baptized in March, 1897, by the Rev. J. Callis in the Mpenga  River.[1] The following year, he was made a member of the Church Council at its  inception.[2] In 1899 he was made *Katikiro* of Toro, and he also became a  lay-reader in the church. In the early days he was very anxious for the  propagation of Christianity and education. He quickly picked up the new ways  which were being introduced in the country. From 1906 to 1907 he acted as *saza* chief of Kibale. He started the church in Kitagwenda and in Kanyambarara.  During his tenure of the office of *katikiro* he was intrigued against,  and this led to his suspension in 1915 and his downfall in c. 1920.[3]

This biography, written by Louise Pirouet, was included in &ldquo;Appendix A: Biographical Notes,&rdquo;  on page 415 of &ldquo;The Expansion  of the Church of Uganda (N.A.C.) from Buganda into Northern and Western Uganda  between 1891 and 1914, with Special Reference to the work of African Teachers  and Evangelists&rdquo; (PhD Thesis: University of East Africa, 1968). Pirouet  published this thesis as *Black  Evangelists* (London: Rex Collings, 1978). However, *Black  Evangelists* does not reproduce the detailed biographies, complete with  references to sources, found in Appendix A of the thesis.
