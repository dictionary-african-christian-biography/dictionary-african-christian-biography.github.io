Mika Sematimba was Uganda’s first Protestant convert to travel to England drumming up support for Christian mission and one of Uganda’s earliest Protestant converts.

Sematimba was born in Ssingo, a county of Buganda, but only lived there until the age of eight when his mother gave him away to the Namasole, the mother of the 30th Kabaka of Buganda, Muteesa I. At thirteen years, he was taken from her enclosure by one of Muteesa’s wives who gave him to his husband as a page.

While at Muteesa’s court, Sematimba showed interest in knowledge and learning the Arabic alphabet and Swahili from Arabs who came to Buganda during Ssekabaka Sunna’s reign. When the White Fathers came to Uganda in 1879, he enrolled in their program and was Simeon Lourdel’s pupil for a time.

On a trip to Zanzibar in 1882, where he had gone to deliver a gift of ivory to Sultan Seyyid Bargash from Muteesa, he met Henry Wright Duta, a fellow Muganda who was a student at the Universities’ Mission. Duta told Sematimba that he was learning to read and write. Contrasting it with his largely oral learning he was receiving at the Catholic mission, he planned on joining the Protestant mission whenever he returned to Uganda.

Upon his return, he became a constant visitor of Alexander Murdoch Mackay, a Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionary stationed at Natete in present-day Kampala, Uganda. In December 1883, he was baptized by Rev. Philip O’Flaherty, taking on the name of Micah from an Old Testament character later localized to Mika.

When Muteesa died on October 10, 1884, and was succeeded by his son, Mwanga II, Sematimba kept the sub-chief role of a messenger, often delivering messages from Mwanga to Mackay (and vice versa) while receiving Christian instruction. Sematimba firmly believed that Mwanga was not a bad man but was instead under bad advice, a unique but not surprising insight because he worked for him.

In 1885, he was elected one of the twelve members of the inaugural church council. Born out of fear that Mwanga might soon expel CMS missionaries, the council’s formation is one of the earliest acts of indigenizing Uganda’s church. Besides being a Christian, you had to be a Ugandan to be elected or vote. The members of this church council are technically the first Protestant church elders in Uganda.

While Mwanga did not, for a time, expel anyone except Mackay, who, on the advice of Muslims, was asked to leave Uganda two years later when persecution of Christians intensified. In July 1885, Seruwanga, Kakumba, and Lugulama were burnt to death alive by Mujasi, the head of Mwanga’s security, who kept telling them to call Jesus to save them. On October 29, 1885, Bishop James Hannington, on his way to Uganda, was killed by Luba, a Musoga chief, allegedly on Mwanga’s orders. The following year, more than sixty Christians were gruesomely killed at Namugongo for nothing more than their faith in Jesus Christ. Thrice Sematimba survived death, eventually fleeing to Kabula, Ankole, with other Christians in 1888.

With Duta, he left Ankole to take letters to Mackay, stationed at Usambiro (present-day Tanzania). He met Rev. R. H. Walker here, forming a strong relationship with him before they both returned to Uganda when Mackay died on February 8, 1890. Sematimba was one of the Christians who declined a chieftaincy immediately following Mwanga’s restoration to the throne.

In January 1891, with Duta, Sembera, Paulo Bakunga, Zakaria Kizito, and Yohana Muyira, Sematimba became one of the first six lay evangelists. Bishop Alfred R. Tucker commissioned them, the first bishop to reach Buganda, a feat two others had failed to achieve. The following year, with the support of the CMS mission, Sematimba became a Makamba, a sub-chief role he remained in for fifty-nine years.

On November 1, 1892, under the auspices of the CMS, whose guest he was, in the company of Walker he had first met at Usambiro, Sematimba arrived in England. He spent months attending meetings where he spoke in support of the CMS mission in Uganda. In January 1893, he attended a gathering organized by the Young Clergy Union requesting more missionaries to be sent to Uganda, citing Matthew 9: 35-38. At the same event, Sematimba entertained attendees by playing various beats from a Ganda drum he had carried. On March 21, he and Walker were interviewed by the CMS Committee of Correspondence, after which they spoke to the CMS Lay Workers Union at the Albert Hall in Sheffield, where he was presented with a splendid hunting knife as a memento.

On May 18, 1895, less than two years after Sematimba’s trip to England, the highest number of missionaries yet set off for Uganda, five of whom were the first female missionaries to Uganda. Sematimba was one of those assigned to welcome them. Later that year, Bishop Tucker, on his third visit, confirmed 2,052 Ugandans into the church.

Sematimba never progressed in the church further, but his work continued to be at the intersection of church and state. He received nearly twelve square miles in the Buganda Agreement of 1900 as a Makamba, part of which was on the Island of Nsonga, where he planted the first church. His successor, however, said this particular piece of land was bought from Mwanga. He had two wives, Lebeeka and Elizabeth. From his first wife, three children survived to adulthood, Lakeeri, Dina, and Nuwa, and from his second wife, Grace, Emily Nalongo, and Drummond, who became a sub-chief in Gomba.

Sematimba died in August 1951 and was buried at Kisozi in Busiro county (also in present-day Wakiso district). He was succeeded by his son of the same family name, whose Christian name was Nuwa, again a localized version of an Old Testament character.
