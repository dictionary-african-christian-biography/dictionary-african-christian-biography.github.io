Of the White Fathers Mission. He joined the White Fathers in 1876, taking his oath in 1878. The same year he was a member of the first caravan of the White Fathers to go to East Africa. On February 17, 1879, he and Fr. Simeon Lourdel landed in Uganda near Entebbe. The place where they landed is marked with a stone monument. In May he went back across Lake Victoria to kageyi taking canoes to fetch Leon Livinhac and his party. In 1882 all the White Fathers temporarily left Buganda but he returned in 1885 after the death of Mwanga, with Frs. Lourdel and Giraud. In 1888 he left Buganda with Livinhac when all the missionaries were expelled (v. Wars of Religion), returning in 1889 to the Sesse Islands. In 1892 to 1894 he served at Marienberg, Willa Mara and in Koki. Here his health finally broke down, and he was carried in a hammock to the Coast, travelling with Bishop Hirth, and he died at Bagamoyo.
