[BUNYORO, Muganda]

Rev. Benjamini Kitugwanide was the son of Luka, one of the  first Baganda converts to be baptized by A. M. Mackay at Natete. Luka was  brother to one of the Regents and was killed in 1891 at the Battle of Kijungute  against the Muslims.[1] Benjamini went to Bugoma about 1899 as a second letter  teacher.[2] In 1908 it was decided that some Banyoro must be trained for  eventual ordination, and Kitugwanide was among those chosen because he was felt  to be entirely assimilated.[3] He was ordained deacon in 1912 and was sent to  Bugoma, a very isolated place for a deacon to be posted to. In 1912 he was  ordained priest,[4] and continued to work at Bugoma until 1918 when he returned  to Buganda.[5] He retired in 1942.[6]
