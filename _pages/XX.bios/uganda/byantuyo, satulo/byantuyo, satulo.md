[TESO,Â  Muganda]

Satulo Byantuyo was educated at Budo. In 1914 he arrived in  Teso, where he had already worked for a while previously, to be headmaster of  Ngora High School.[1] He was a very good teacher who worked hard, was friendly  with the Iteso, and did much to &ldquo;uplift&rdquo; the school.[2] After some years he  returned to Buganda, but in 1948 he came back to Teso on a prolonged visit,  staying at Kyere, and with [Yakobo Okwerede](okwerede_yakobo.html) and Archdeacon Odiit. He did not finally  return to Buganda until 1963.[3]
