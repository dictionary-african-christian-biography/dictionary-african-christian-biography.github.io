[TORO and BUNYORO, Clan: Baitara]

Leo Kaboha was born in Mwenge.  His father died when he was very young at a time when the country was suffering  from a smallpox epidemic and from cattle disease, so the family moved to  Bunyoro where the sickness was less severe. As a young man he stayed around the  court, and joined in some of Kabarega&rsquo;s campaigns, making himself a name for  reliance and leadership. He was made a sub-chief, and he remained in this  position until 1905 when he was made a *saza* chief, *Kimbugwe* of  Buruli. He was baptized as a Catholic about 1901. Because of his involvement in  the *Nyangire* rising against the Baganda chiefs in 1907 he was deprived  of his chieftaincy and sent back to Mwenge, now in Toro. He then received a  chieftaincy around the Salt Lake at Katwe, and was later appointed *saza* chief of Kitagweta with his headquarters a Matiri in what is now Kyaka.  Throughout Kabarega&rsquo;s lifetime he continued loyal to him, and would never let  him be mentioned except respectfully by his title in his household. He was very  thorough in all he did, and a staunch Catholic. He had a chapel in his  homestead and everyone had to attend daily prayers at 6.00 AM. He died of  pneumonia in 1937, and two years later his son, Mako Kaboha, became *katikiro* of Toro.
