Rev. Arthur Bryant Fisher of the Church Missionary Society  (CMS) arrived in Uganda in 1892. In April 1893 he established a CMS station at  Mityana where he devised a system of &ldquo;reading-houses&rdquo; built by the people in  the surrounding areas, each manned by two African teachers. He and senior  teachers supervised the work. The advantages of this system were seen by Pilkington and the patter  became standard throughout Uganda. In 1894 he opened work at Kasaka; in 1895 he  was the first missionary to visit Koki and obtained permission from Kamswaga  (the King) to open a station at Rakai. In the same year he opened work at  Kinakulya, Singo. In 1895-1896 he travelled through Bunyoro to the  consternation of the government as the country had not yet been &ldquo;pacified.&rdquo; In  1896 he travelled to Toro with Bishop Tucker to establish European missionaries at Kabarole. In  1899 he opened work at Masindi and Hoima in Bunyoro. From 1900-1903 he worked  in Toro, and married Ruth Hurditch, a fellow-missionary. In 1903 Fisher and the  Rev. A. L. (later Bishop)  Kitching climbed to the snows of Ruwenzori. From 1905-1913 he worked in  Bunyoro. He played a significant part in helping to restore peace at the time  of the Bunyoro rising against the Baganda chiefs in 1907. In 1913 he went to  Gulu, Acoli, to re-open CMS work in that area. He retired from Uganda in 1913.  Mrs. Fisher was the author of *On the  Borders of Pygmy-land* (1905) and *Twilight  Tales of the Black Baganda* (1911). The latter gives a valuable early  account of Noro traditions of the Baowezi and Babito dynasties.
