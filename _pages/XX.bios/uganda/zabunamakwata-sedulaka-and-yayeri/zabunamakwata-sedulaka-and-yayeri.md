[TORO and [illegible], Muganda]

Sedulaka Zabunamakwata was a teacher who first went to Toro  in 1895, and the following year went to Mboga. On this first occasion he was  not able to stay long as the *Mukama* put difficulties in the way of the  teachers and refused them food. But later in the year he volunteered to return  with Apolo Kivebulaya when things had taken a turn for the better. Both teachers  again suffered considerable opposition on their return, and then the area was  raided by the Manyuama. In 1897 he returned to Toro to ask advice of the  missionaries. In 1898 after much further trouble, and after Kivebulaya had been  wrongfully imprisoned, matters were settled at a court case in Toro and the *Mukama* paid compensation for losses suffered by Kivebulaya and the CMS. Once more,  Sedulaka and Apolo returned to Mboga. Later in the year Mboga was visited by  Bishop Tucker, who was escorted there by Sedulaka, Kivebulaya having gone on  ahead. In 1899 they again returned to Toro after political trouble.[1] Now the  two were sent to Kitagwenda, but again Sedulaka had a difficult time, and in  1900 he was therefore sent to [illegible].[2] In August he was moved again, and  at the end of the year returned to Mboga.[3] In April 1902 he was back at  Kabarole and was unanimously elected to a seat on the church council &ldquo;in  recognition of his long and faithful services as a senior teacher in Toro.&rdquo;[4]  In 1903 his wife Yayeri qualified as a teacher. In February of 1905 they went  back to Mboga, but by July Yayeri was back in Kabarole, possibly alone.[5] When  Sedulaka eventually returned to Buganda, Yayeri did not go with him, and in  1922 she was still working as a church teacher in Toro.[6]
