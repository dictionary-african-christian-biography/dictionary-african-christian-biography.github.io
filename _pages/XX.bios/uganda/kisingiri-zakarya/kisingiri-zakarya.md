Rev. Zakarya Kizito Kisingiri was a leading Protestant  chief. Prior to the coming of the missionaries he was a *mutongole* (official responsible to the *Kabaka*). He started to visit the CMS mission in 1882, and  was baptized in December 1883 having eventually agreed to give up all but one  wife. He often acted as a Luganda/Kiswahili interpreter for the missionaries.  He became a member of the Church Council formed during the persecutions of 1885-1886  to enable the church to carry on if the missionaries had to flee. In 1888 he  became one of the leaders of the Christian exiles in Ankole (v. Wars of Religion). In  1889 he was appointed to another sub-chieftainship (Kagoro) in Buddu. In 1891  he was one of the first group to be commissioned as lay-evangelists by Bishop Alfred Robert Tucker.  The same year he accompanied Lugard on his expedition to western Uganda to  fetch Emin Pasha&rsquo;s Sudanese troops from Kavalli&rsquo;s. It was he who brought Kasagama, heir to the  royal line of Toro, to Lugard&rsquo;s notice, and thus he was instrumental in getting  him reinstated as *Omukama*. Both Lugard and later Sir Gerald Portal held a  high opinion of Kisingiri. In 1892 he was appointed *Kengao* of Bulemezi.  In 1893 he was ordained perpetual deacon at the same time as Nikodemo Sebwato the *Sekibobo* of Kyagwe, in the first ordination every to be held in Uganda. In 1896 he stood  as godfather to Kasagama of Toro. In 1897 when Mwanga rose in arms and Daudi  Chwa was proclaimed *Kabaka* in his place, Kisingiri was appointed one of  three regents, the other being Apolo Kagwa and Stanislaus Mugwanya. The same year he visited Kasagama, and  performed marriages and baptisms in Toro. In 1899 he visited Ankole and added  his voice to those trying to persuade the *Omugabe* to accept Christian  Teaching. In 1900 he was one of the signatories to the Uganda Agreement. He  remained a member of the Diocesan Council almost up to the time of his death,  though after 1900 he had little time for work as a deacon. He died in 1917 and  was buried at Bajo in Bulemezi.
