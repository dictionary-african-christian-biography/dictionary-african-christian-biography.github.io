[ACOLI]

Edwadi Kija was a pupil of [Sira Dongo](dongo_sira.html) during the  period when there were no European missionaries in Acoli. Baptized at Masindi  on September 4, 1910 by the Rev. H. E. Tegart.[1] He became a teacher, and  during the next few years his name appears from time to time in the *Gulu  Service Book*. In 1921 he went to teach at Lira, Lengo.[2] From 1918 when  the Church Council was formed, until 1922 he was a member of it.[3] In 1918 he  was awarded an honorary first letter because of the good work he had done as a  teacher although he had never received any training.[4] He contracted  tuberculosis, of which he died.[5]
