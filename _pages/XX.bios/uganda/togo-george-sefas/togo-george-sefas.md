[ANKOLE]

Sefas George Togo was baptized on May 10, 1903 at Mbarara,  and was first appointed as one of the soldiers who guarded the *Mugabe*.  He was then made market-master at Mbarara.[1] In 1908 he was appointed *saza* chief of Igara when Mukontani was murdered.[2] He was a good *saza* chief,  and built many churches and schools. He remained in this position until his  death in 1934.[3]

This biography, written by Louise Pirouet, was included in &ldquo;Appendix A: Biographical Notes,&rdquo;  on page 424 of &ldquo;The Expansion  of the Church of Uganda (N.A.C.) from Buganda into Northern and Western Uganda  between 1891 and 1914, with Special Reference to the work of African Teachers  and Evangelists&rdquo; (PhD Thesis: University of East Africa, 1968).
