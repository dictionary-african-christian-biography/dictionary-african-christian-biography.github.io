Scopion Maftaa Dallington originally came from Nyasaland [now Malawi] where he was taken as a slave in childhood. He was liberated and educated by the Universities Mission to Central Africa in Zanzibar [now part of Tanzania]. He became a servant to H. M. Stanley, accompanying him on his journey to Lake Victoria in 1875. At Mutesa’s court he helped Stanley to translate portions of the Bible into Kiswahili and when Stanley left, Dallington remained behind at Mutesa’s request to continue to instruct him in Christianity and to act as secretary. He was only about sixteen at this time. Mutesa prompted him to debate religion at the court with Sheikh Ahmed bin Ibrahim before the arrival of the missionaries. He read Christian prayers at court. When the missionaries of the Church Missionary Society first arrived, he interpreted for them. Within a year or two he accepted a chieftaincy in Buddu and gave up all pretensions of Christianity.
