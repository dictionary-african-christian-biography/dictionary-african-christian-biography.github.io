James  William King was an ordained minister of the Methodist Church in The Gambia and  one of its longest serving workers in the 19th century.

Very  few details about King&rsquo;s life are known and there are no data about his life before  he started working for the Methodist Church. It seems he was a Gambian (rather  than e.g. a Sierra Leonean who had moved to Bathurst) because he is described  as being fluent in Wolof and Mandinka. His name seems to suggest that he was liberated  African, rather than a Wolof or Mandinka. [1]

King  was employed as a catechist around 1879, a position he held for about six years;  he served at MacCarthy Island and in British Kombo. In 1885 he was recommended as  a ministerial candidate.[2] The minutes of the Methodist Synod of 1885 describe  King as an senior candidate (he was 48) who was considered suitable for the  ministry because he was&quot;&lsquo;married, strong and healthy, pious and strictly  moral.&quot;[3]

King  received his ministerial training in the Gambia, though his theological  formation seems to have been rather minimalistic. The synod of 1887 reported that  King had done little in the way of writing exams, but did not make an issue out  of this, arguing King was already advanced in years and had difficulty writing.[3]  In 1890 King was recommended to be received into full connection. The Synod  recommendation states that King was &ldquo;a man of excellent character&rdquo; and was able  to speak and preach fluently in Wolof and Mandinka.[4] He was ordained in 1891  without having completed his probation exams.[5]

After  his ordination King continued to serve the Bathurst church. When in 1897 he was  scheduled to be transferred to MacCarthy Island, he declined on medical grounds  and requested to be made a supernumerary. He had reached the age of sixty by  then. The request was granted and King continued to serve the Methodist church  as a supernumerary for another 16 years.[6] During this period his name was listed  under the Bathurst circuit. Among other things he served as a chaplain to the  army and led the temperance society.

In  1913 King had a stroke, but despite this physical setback, he was still deemed  to be &ldquo;a splendid old worker and now in his affliction very bright and cheerful.&rdquo;[7]  In 1914 King passed away, aged 76.[8] He had served the Methodist Church for 6  years as a catechist, for 12 years as an active itinerant minister and another  16 years as a supernumerary, a total of 34 years. This makes King one of the  longest serving Methodist church workers in the Gambia in the 19th  century.

The  archival sources offer no particulars about the way King exercised his ministry.  But Delaney Russell&rsquo;s tribute to King is revealing. In his letter to the  Missionary Committee in London informing them of the King&rsquo;s death, Russell  wrote: &ldquo;His name is still fragrant in the Combo&rsquo;s and MacCarthy,&rdquo; alluding to 2  Corinthians 2:15 in which Paul encourages people to dedicate their lives to Christ  as a sweet smelling sacrifice. A worthy praise for a faithful worker.

Another long-serving  Gambian was the local preacher andÂ  later  assistant missionary John Gum, a Wolof slave who was ransomed by the Methodist  Church around 1835. Gum became a local preacher around 1824 and served as an  assistant missionary between 1835 and 1848. After his retirement on medical  grounds in 1848 (he became blind) he continued to serve as a chapel keeper and  a local preacher until at least 1859, a total of 35 years.
