Samba (Jean?) was – as far as records show - the first Gambian to  be ordained a priest in the Roman Catholic Church and the only Gambian Roman  Catholic priest in the 19th century.

The Spiritan archives on the Gambia contain precious few  details on Samba. Most of what is known about Samba comes from a confidential  file dated 1879, which contains letters and other materials pertaining to  Samba&rsquo;s conduct and his suitability for the priesthood.[1] Sources also seem to  contradict each other. Hence it is difficult to deduct a coherent biography  from the sources.

Samba was a Gambian and probably born in Bathurst but neither  his date of birth nor his Christian name are certain. Secondary literature cites  1842 or 1845 as possible dates of birth, but it is unclear on the basis of  which primary sources these claims are made.[2] According to Joseph Roger de  Benoist, Samba&rsquo;s first name was Jean, but no primary sources are referenced to  substantiate this.[3] His family name suggests that he was of Wolof descent.

It seems that Samba offered for the priesthood in 1859,  encouraged by the Vicar Apostolic of the Senegambia Aloysius Kobès, who  actively promoted indigenous ministry. Together with some Senegalese young men  Samba enrolled in the seminary in Dakar. In 1862 Samba was sent to Rome to  study at the seminary of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. In 1869,  while in Rome, Mgr. Kobès ordained Samba a diocesan priest. Later documents suggest  that at the time of the ordination, there were hesitations as to whether Samba was  ready for the priesthood.

In 1870 Samba arrived in Bathurst to serve as parish priest  on St. Mary&rsquo;s Island. Soon, his colleagues – African as well as European – began  to make critical remarks about his conduct: he was considered to be negligent  in his devotions and they considered his mother&rsquo;s influence over him too  strong. At some point between 1871 and 1873 Samba fell ill and was sent to  France to recuperate.[4] Possibly he entered the Congregation of the Holy Ghost  during this period, because from his stay in France onwards he is mentioned as a  Spiritan- rather than a diocesan priest.[5]

In 1873 Samba, now a member of a missionary  congregation, was sent to Sierra Leone.  There are two different narratives as to what  happened in the years that followed. According to Henry Koren, who takes the *Bulletin Général* of the congregation as  the basis for his biography, Samba continued to work in Sierra Leone, suffering  from an undiagnosed illness and repeatedly falling ill. Koren interprets Samba&rsquo;s  stays in Banjul and Joal as well as his time in France as periods to recuperate.[6]  Confidential archival sources however seem to tell a somewhat different tale  than the published materials. They suggest that Samba ran into problems with  his superiors in Sierra Leone, who criticized him for twice leaving his station  without the permission of his superior. At least one of these occasions seem to  have concerned a family matter. The Senegalese Spiritan Jean Lacombe, who served  as parish priest in Bathurst between 1865 and 1876, reported that Samba  travelled to Bathurst in 1874 to console his mother after the death of his  father.[7] The archival sources also suggest that because of what the sources call  Samba&rsquo;s &ldquo;repeated disobedience,&rdquo; Samba was dismissed from the Congregation of  the Holy Ghost and was sent back to his bishop in Dakar. There, the Vicar  Apostolic Jean-Claude Duret (1873-1875) re-stationed him at Joal.

Also in Joal, Samba&rsquo;s superiors criticized his behavior.  Duret&rsquo;s successor, François Duboin wrote to Cardinal Siméoni of the Society for  the Propagation of the Faith that Samba&rsquo;s habits were becoming more and more  problematic;  Samba was said to be too  liberal with the other sex, to engage in gossip and to use excessive amounts of  alcohol. [8] As a result Samba was suspended, probably around 1875 or 1876, and  sent to France to re-examine his vocation. In December 1878, Samba&rsquo;s suspension  was lifted and he was allowed to take up his priesthood again, but it seems his  superiors in West Africa were not eager to receive him. Duboin wrote to  Siméoni, suggesting that Samba should either retire in France or be defrocked,  but under no circumstances be allowed to return to the Senegambia.[9] It is unclear  why Duboin was so adamant that Samba was not to return to West Africa. Samba  himself wanted to go to America, probably to make a fresh start in his  ministry.[10]

Siméoni decided differently; neither Duboin&rsquo;s nor  Samba&rsquo;s wishes were honored and in 1880 Samba was back in the Gambia.[11] It is  uncertain, whether the letter sent by Samba&rsquo;s mother to the Vicar General of  the Spiritans, Ignace Schwindenhammer ,had any influence on the decision to send  Samba to the Gambia. Mrs. Samba, who was seriously ill, had begged  Schwindenhammer to allow her son to visit her.[12] Shortly after Samba returned  to Bathurst, Mrs. Samba died. A number of incidents shortly after her death in 1880  gave rise to a new series of complaints about Samba. According to his superior  Alois Meyer, Samba had quarrelled with a woman over the inheritance and had bought  large quantities of liquor for his mother&rsquo;s charity. Both incidents were used  by the Protestants to discredit the reputation of the Roman Catholic mission.[13]  Also the fact that Samba, no longer a member of the Congregation of the Holy  Ghost, was not living with the other priests, was material for Protestant anti-  Roman Catholic propaganda. According to Meyer, the Protestants used this to spread  a rumor that Samba was creating a schism within the Gambian Roman Catholic  Church.[14] Neither Meyer&rsquo;s desperate pleas to recall Samba to France nor the  petition of the Roman Catholic community of St. Mary&rsquo;s that Samba not be expelled  from the priesthood[15] required a response. On January 9, 1881, Samba died of  pneumonia. Just before he died, he made his confession and is said to have expressed  regrets about his disobedience. In his letter to Duboin Meyer wrote: &ldquo;Many  people attended the funeral and think God did well to recall him in this  situation.&rsquo;&rsquo;[16]

It is difficult to give an assessment of Samba&rsquo;s years  as a priest. The available sources are fragmentary, pre-dominantly European,  and mainly written by his superiors. There are no indications that racism was a  factor in the strained relations between Samba and his superiors; Senegalese  contemporaries of Samba served the churches in Senegal and the Gambia for many  years. Rather, the sources seem to suggest a certain forbearance on the part of  his superiors; Samba was given several opportunities to make a fresh start in  new context. Whether Samba was still too immature for the priesthood, whether  he was unsuitable for the priesthood or whether he had mental problems as  Benoist seems to suggest, remains uncertain.[17] Obvious is that Samba&rsquo;s example  did not inspire vocations to the priesthood in the Gambia. It would take  another forty years before the next Gambian priest – Joseph Charles Mendy – was  to be ordained.
