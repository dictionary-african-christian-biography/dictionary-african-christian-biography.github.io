Charles Joseph Mendy was a Gambian Roman Catholic priest.  Mendy served the Gambian Roman Catholic Church for eight years (1924-1932)  only; his career was cut short when he unexpectedly died during an operation.  Mendy was widely considered a saint by his contemporaries.

Few  details are known about Charles Joseph Mendy. He was born in Bathurst, but neither  his date of birth nor his parentage are known; the name Mendy suggests Manjago  descent. Mendy was sent to the Junior Seminary in Ngasobil in 1909 and had his  entire formation in Senegal.

He  was ordained on June 22, 1924 in Bathurst, the first Gambian in 55 years to be  ordained into the priesthood. According to the archival material, people of all  denominations attended his ordination and also many priests and religious from  Senegal were present. The Spiritan *Journal de la communauté *states: &ldquo;in  truth the day that the Lord hath made, a red letter day in the History of  Bathurst which witnesses for the first time the ordination of a priest and then  it is one of our own, a native of Bathurst.&rdquo; The *Journal* of the Spiritan Congregation also reported that never  before had there been so many priests in the Gambia.[1]

Mendy  served as a parish priest in Hagan Street, Bathurst and soon acquired a saintly  reputation because of his piety. Oral history states that Mendy lived an  ascetic life, spent much of his time in prayer and shared all he had with the  poor.[2] The same oral tradition states that on several occasions, unannounced  visitors to the church found Mendy in a levitated state, lost in prayer.[3]  Though this claim is not substantiated in written sources, the narrative  indicates the respect and standing Mendy had acquired amongst the Bathurst  congregation.

Unexpectedly,  on July 12, 1932, Mendy died during a bowel operation. The tributes paid to him  after his death suggest that Mendy was a committed and compassionate pastor. The *Journal* records: &ldquo;The mission lost in  him a hardworking and good missionary.&rdquo;[4] His German colleague Fr. Aloyse  Haegy (1922-1946) called him &ldquo;a priest who was very dedicated to his work.&rdquo;[5]  Only Fr. John Meehan, the superior of the mission, was more critical. Though he  admitted that Mendy had been a good priest, he also called him stubborn and arrogant.[6]  Then again, Meehan was later associated with racist behavior.[7] It is possible  that this outlook on Africans also influenced his evaluation of Mendy.

Oral  tradition has given its own appraisal of Mendy, stating that many of Mendy&rsquo;s  contemporaries, both Muslims and Christians, considered him to be a saint. [8]

1. Entry June 22,  1924, Journal de Ste. Marie de Bathurst IV, 1924-1958, Box 4i2.4. The comment  that the ordination of Mendy was the first priestly ordination ever in  Bathurst, is not quite accurate. Already on April 4, 1849, Bishop Kobès  ordained Henry Warlop into the priesthood.

Note:  archival material (journals, diaries, reports, letters) from the start of the  mission in 1821 until 1965 can be found in the Archives of the Holy Ghost  Fathers in Chevilly-Larue, Paris. The Archives in Chevilly-Larue also have the  complete series of the *Bulletin Général  de la Congrégation du St. Esprit et du Sacré Coeur de Marie *(1857- ).

Cleary adds that this generosity extended to the  distribution of mission property, to the extreme annoyance of his colleague Fr.  Meehan. Meehan to Le Hunsec, Bathurst, June 21, 1932, Box 4I1.1B, File II  Gambie/Bathurst, Correspondence 1932-1935, folder 1 Correspondence Meehan and  Whiteside 1932/33.

Meehan calls him rogue, arrogant, doing things his own  way: &rdquo;C&rsquo;était un bon prêtre mais un rogue. (…) Il était à moitié formé. Il faisait  tout à la façon de sa tête et je crois que s&rsquo;il avait veçu il devendrait fou.&ldquo;

7. In later years Meehan clashed with Fr.  Thomas Jobe and oral tradition links the conflict to racist behavior by Meehan.
