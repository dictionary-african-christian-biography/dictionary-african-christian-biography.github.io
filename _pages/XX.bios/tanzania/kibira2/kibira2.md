Josiah Kibira was  a bishop in the Lutheran Church in Tanzania. He also served as president of the  Lutheran World Federation (1977-1984). In his ministry and leadership, he put  forward a view of the Church as both global and local; he brought together the  center and the periphery.

From a small fishing village on  the shores of Lake Victoria to the presidency of the Lutheran World Federation,  Josiah Kibira knit the concerns of both the local and the global church  together into a single garment. He came in contact with numerous strands of the  Christian tradition, which drove him to profound theological reflection on the  nature and meaning of Christianity for Africa, as well as the significance of  Africa for Christianity. Kibira was able to see the potential within different  streams of theology, but he also saw the dangers. No one thinker had &ldquo;the whole  truth,&rdquo; but rather he sought to give all voices a place at the table.

**Early Life**

In late August of  1925, in Bukoba, Tanzania, Esteria Kibira gave birth to a son. She lived with  her husband, Isaya Kibira, and a co-wife; they were members of the Haya ethnic  group. Only days after his birth, the child became desperately ill, and it was  not clear whether he would live. When the child pulled through the sickness,  Isaya named him Josiah Mutabuzi. Josiah is a biblical name meaning &ldquo;the Lord  heals,&rdquo; and in the Haya language, Mutabuzi means &ldquo;he is a savior.&rdquo; Isaya died  while Josiah was still young, and he remembered being raised by his devout mother.  As he said, &ldquo;[my mother] tried to teach us how we should follow the Lord and  that we had to go to church. She also taught us to pray and sing. I especially  learned from her how to pray in faith and very simply.&rdquo; [1]

Josiah&rsquo;s father played a pivotal  role in bringing Christianity to Bukoba. According to the historian Bengdt  Sundkler, the kings of the Bukoba region were not particularly keen on having  Christian missionaries in the area. They were the guardians of the traditional  moral order and feared that white foreigners would undermine them. King  Mukotani said, &ldquo;If the whites are allowed to teach everywhere, what will not  this new religion do? Will not then even our rivers and forests &lsquo;believe?&rsquo; Will  our sacred trees escape and not be cut down like ordinary trees?&rdquo; [2] It was  only after the German colonial government put pressure on these leaders that  the White Fathers built catholic mission stations in the area. Yet it was not  at these stations that Isaya came in contact with Christianity. He was a  fisherman and trader who traversed the banks of Lake Victoria in his canoe.  Crossing into Uganda, Isaya and his fellow traders came in contact with the  Anglican Church Mission Society. Over the course of five trips and several  years, missionaries and Buganda converts introduced Isaya to a whole new world  of roads, bridges, education, and modern medicine. It was also here that he  learned about Christianity. Back in Bukoba, Isaya taught people what he had  learned and gathered a community of believers around him. As Christianity was  not popular in the region, they met secretly in a cave by the banks of the  Lake. When Pastor Ernst Johanssen from the German Bethel Society came to Bukoba  in 1907, he did not need to plant a church—rather he built on the foundations  already laid by Isaya. [3] As Isaya died, he said &ldquo;My sons still carry on what  I wanted to do and could not achieve.&rdquo; [4]

The Bethel missionary at Bukoba  baptized the young Josiah, and as he came of age, he received an early  education at Kashenye Village School and religious instruction from the  missionaries. At fifteen, he was confirmed. [5] The German missionaries were  particularly sensitive to African culture. Bruno Gutmann, Traugott Bachmann,  and Ernst Johanssen believed that God was present within and (imperfectly)  revealed through African religion, social order, and customs. Because of this,  it was not the objective of German missionaries to completely overturn African  culture; on the contrary, they wanted to preserve and Christianize it. The  objective of the missionary was only to introduce a people (*Volk*) to the gospel. In the same way  that missionaries believed that Africans knew about God before their arrival,  they also believed that Africans already had a God-given sense of ethics.  According to this view, Christianity and African religions shared an ethical  basis. To be sure, the German missionaries were not completely tolerant; they  argued that some aspects of traditional culture were contrary to the gospel.  Nevertheless, even those elements of traditional culture, social order, and  religious rites that contradicted the gospel could be Christianized and used in  the service of a people&rsquo;s unique Church (*Volkskirche*).  Finally, German missionaries believed that the greatest danger for Africans  came from European &ldquo;civilization.&rdquo; Espousing a romantic view, they believed  that modernity, with its accompanying migratory labor, free market economies,  and a sense of individualism, destroyed the stable social fabric of African  village and church life. [6] While these exact points may not have been made  within a catechism class, Kibira was a product of a missionary education that  attempted to reconcile the gospel with African culture. As Kibira matured as a  theologian, he too would tackle the question of what it meant to be both  African and Christian.

**Higher Education**

Kibira proved to  be an apt student, and continued his education at the Kigarama Secondary  School. He wrote hymns, participated in the choir, and took an interest in  theater. It was also at Kigarama that Kibira began his lifelong ministry.  According to Angolowisye Malambugi, at Kigarama, Kibira baptized a sick elderly  woman who miraculously recovered. After passing his examination, Kibira went on  to the Nyakato Government Secondary School in 1942. He was a fastidious  Christian in those days, and his friends remembered him as both earnest and hard  working. He excelled in academics, led prayer services, and conducted Bible  studies. The church leadership even made Kibira an elder. [7]

But his Christian religion  gained another dimension at this time. Kibira came in contact with a movement  that made him reconsider his previous life. [8] Beginning in the 1930s, the  fires of the Balokole revival swept through the East African Protestant mission  churches. Balokole, meaning &ldquo;the saved ones,&rdquo; criticized the lax attitude of &ldquo;lukewarm  Christians,&rdquo; and called people to a sincere faith and high standards of  morality. The Balokole formed their own kind of clan, separating themselves  from their nominal Christian neighbors, attempting to live an exemplary life  that refused to compromise with the &ldquo;world.&rdquo; Even so, for the most part, the  Balokole remained within the Protestant Churches. [9]

Two Anglican preachers of the  Balokole tradition arrived at Nyakato in March 1947 and preached for three days  on the necessity of sincere conversion and an uncompromising position toward  the world. These words resonated with Kibira, and forced him to re-narrate his  own life. He decided that he had been a hypocrite up to that point—his outward  actions may have appeared holy, but he had not really committed himself fully  to Christ. At midnight on March 21, 1947, Kibira said the following prayer, &ldquo;Lord  Jesus, come into my heart.&rdquo; He confessed his sins to his roommate and declared  himself reborn the next morning. [10]

The Balokole movement provided  Kibira with new possibilities. Through the movement, he met Martha Yeremiah.  The two were no doubt drawn together by shared experience and piety, and they  married. Traditionally, however, the marriage would not have happened. As  Kibira recalled, "According to  Customary Law I had no right to marry this woman as she was of a royal family  and I came from a quite simple fisherman&rsquo;s family. I had myself obtained the  consent of my wife. She had got permission from her father to marry a young man  whom she would choose." [11] They were both  members of the Balokole movement, and they chose each other. This marked a new  pattern of social arrangements in East Africa.

Both the German missionaries and  the members of the Balokole movement were committed to local communities.  Nevertheless, both German Lutheran missionaries and the Balokole had ties with  various world-wide movements. By the middle of the 20th century,  local Protestant bodies throughout the work were linked into global networks  that came in contact at ecumenical conferences and in universities. In 1957,  after spending some time as a teacher in Tanzania, Josiah went to the Bethel  Mission&rsquo;s Kirchliche Hochschule in Beilefeld, West Germany. There he studied to  be a minister. [12] He brought revivalist methods to Germany, and in doing so  upset the standard European/missionary hierarchy. The paternalistic assumption  of missions was that converts learned at the feet of white missionaries. Yet  Kibira claimed that missionaries needed to be humbled before Christ in the same  way that Africans did. This also meant that white missionaries did not have  unique access to Christ and the Christian tradition, and therefore did not  deserve unique leadership within the Churches. [13]

**Bishop at Boston University**

Kibira was an  outspoken advocate of an independent Lutheran Church. He was an exacting  Christian with a radical bent. The combination could prove to be upsetting and  perhaps a little frustrating or even terrifying to missionaries who supported  the status quo. Yet one white missionary found in Kibira a worthy leader. Bengt  Sundkler, who will long be remembered as a skilled linguist, ethnographer,  historian, and missionary, was appointed Bishop of Bukoba in 1960. Kibira had  both too grand a vision and too little patience to make a good village  pastor—he did not fit comfortably into one parish. Yet rather than focusing on this  as a problem, Sundkler saw the potential for leadership. At the 1961 meeting of  the World Council of Churches in New Delhi, Sundkler nominated Josiah Kibira to  be a member of the faith and order commission. [14] Likewise, working in  conjunction with the Lutheran World Federation, he found scholarship money to  send Kibira to Boston University, where the latter studied from 1962 to 1964.  Sundkler remembered visiting Kibira at Boston, saying that his protégé had  adopted local American customs. When Sundkler arrived, Kibira took him around  to various students at the school, introducing them to &ldquo;my Bishop from Bukoba.&rdquo;  According to Sundkler, this was &ldquo;a thing that only Americans could do.&rdquo; [15] At  Boston University, Kibira studied with Sundkler&rsquo;s old acquaintance from Sweden,  Nils Ehrenström. Ehrenström, who was a veteran of the Life and Work movement,  taught as professor of Ecumenism at Boston University from 1955 until 1969. [16]  By 1964, Kibira earned his masters at the School of Theology, and had an offer  to begin work on a doctoral dissertation. Sundkler, however, had other plans  for him. [17]

Kibira returned to an  independent Lutheran Church in Tanzania—formed in 1963. Across Africa, &ldquo;the  winds of change&rdquo; were blowing, and increasingly more Africans demanded their  independence from Europeans in all areas of life. [18] This was a call that  many missionaries heeded. Sundkler knew that the time for an African bishop had  come. In conjunction with the pastors and the diocese, it was decided that  Sundkler would carry on acting as Bishop with an African assistant. In 1964,  the synod elected Kibira. He was consecrated in September of the same year, 100  years after the first African Anglican bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther. The  consecration was very much an ecumenical event; Moravians, Anglicans, and  Lutherans all participated. Kibira would not be Sundkler&rsquo;s assistant for long.  Only three months later, Sundkler returned to Sweden, leaving the diocese in  the hands of his former assistant. Kibira worked as Bishop of the Northwestern  Diocese of the Lutheran Church in Tanzania for the next two decades. [19]

**Global Leader**

Sundkler stepped  aside so that Kibira could come into the limelight. As Bishop, Kibira was able  to develop his ecclesiological vision for Africa on the ecumenical stage. In  October of 1965, Kibira gave the keynote speech at the All Africa Conference of  Churches in Addis Ababa. In his speech, entitled &ldquo;A Changing Church in a Living  Society,&rdquo; Kibira utilized and synthesized the various streams of thought that  he had been learning and developing over the course of his life. He identified  a number of tensions facing the Churches in Africa. Reflecting some of the  older German theologies, Kibira called on the church in Africa to be  authentically African. The Churches in Africa, he argued, needed not only  political but also spiritual freedom to fully come into themselves. He wrote:

> Both  ecclesiological and theological freedom are lacking in African churches. There  is need for change of the church&rsquo;s ecclesiological foreign image and [to] make  it more indigenous. This change must affect church buildings, liturgy, forms of  worship, and symbolism…We depend mostly on advisors from Europe and America. Our  Theological Boards are very inadequate as long as they reflect American,  Swedish, or German Lutheran theologies rather than African theologies…Research  into African religious beliefs has revealed that nearly all Africans believed  in God. Some tribes possessed an elaborate religious system including  superstition, magic and ancestral worship, taboos, and reverence of the sacred  and the aged. If this is true, then theologians are needed today to find out  what all these African beliefs have in common...[and] these data must be  evaluated in light of the Christian message. [20]
>

Yet after  affirming this, Kibira went on to note how spiritual freedom posed a serious  challenge to unity. Differences in thought, practice, and opinion could easily  cause friction, and Kibira did not want to superficially do away with  difference to find the lowest common denominator of agreement. To do so, after  all, would only limit freedom of thought. His solution to this problem was one  of unity amid diversity. &ldquo;We are Lutherans,&rdquo; he wrote, &ldquo;we know &lsquo;in whom&rsquo; and  &lsquo;what&rsquo; we believe. We have particular emphasis in our doctrine; especially in  this precious one—&lsquo;Justification by faith alone&rsquo;—and in many others. But this,  our very heritage, is our challenge.&rdquo; [21] Kibira argued that Lutherans needed  to make their position clear within ecumenical discourse, seeking to share the  insights of their own particular body with the rest of the Church. Even if the  unique insights of each denomination conflicted, all needed to participate in  the dialogue from their own unique position. There was also much to be gained  from such open conversation. Kibira wrote, &ldquo;We [Lutherans] rejoice because we  have a relatively clear understanding of our confession…Yet, at the same time,  we would be wrong if we would bluntly say: &lsquo;*We* have the whole truth.&rsquo; Such a generalization would be &lsquo;killing faith.&rsquo;&rdquo; [22] In  this way, diversity could be maintained while unity and fuller depth of  knowledge was established through conversation.

The freedom to be African also  gave rise to another tension. At Addis Ababa, Kibira talked about two kinds of &ldquo;tradition.&rdquo;  He said there are traditions—with a small &ldquo;t&rdquo;—that represent the unique  characteristics and textures of African cultures and societies, and there is  Tradition—with a large &ldquo;T&rdquo;—that include the Gospels, the Epistles, and Church  history. Thus, there was a kind of tension between the local dimension of a  specific Church and the universal dimension of the whole Christian church.  Here, he addressed the question of indigenization, writing,

> There are many  good traditions in the African culture which have made an impact on groups of  people. These traditions convey unique values. We must be careful before we  abandon them as Christianity is introduced. If they are indigenous, then we  need to give them Christian meaning and root the Gospel into the African soil.  At this point it has to be mentioned that the real &ldquo;indigenizer&rdquo; is the African  himself. [23]
>

Again, Kibira  placed himself in the tradition of German missionaries. There was, however, one  key difference: the foreign missionary was not to be the one to indigenize the  church. On the contrary, it would be the African Christians themselves. African  Christians understood both traditions and Tradition; they were the ones who  could best understand how to root Christianity in African soil. Much of  Kibira&rsquo;s work focused on understanding how African concepts of kinship could  dialogue with Christian ideas of fellowship. He attempted to root Christianity  in indigenous African worldviews while at the same time offering a model of  fellowship to the wider church.

Tradition, regardless of small  or large &ldquo;T&rsquo;s,&rdquo; was a chain that related people to their spiritual and familial  ancestors. Kibira recognized still another potential problem. He wrote, &ldquo;Chains  can bind; become rigid and sterile.&rdquo; Many Protestant Churches became set in  their ways, the worship became cold, and the general level of commitment  dropped. Kibira argued that the Churches needed revival. [24] Much in the same  way that his own faith and commitment to the Church was deepened by his  experience with the Balokole movement, Kibira called on the Churches to always  rekindle their spiritual energies, and direct them toward the world.

> The main emphasis  of the revival has always been &ldquo;JESUS.&rdquo; The *Abalokole* maintain that in order to be a Christian, one has to accept Jesus Christ the  Son of God as his personal Savior, and that this cannot be achieved unless one  repents and puts right the things one had damaged during one&rsquo;s rebellion and  then receives in faith God&rsquo;s forgiveness. The Christian&rsquo;s life then becomes a  walk in the light and a willingness to repent daily of all sins. From this  forgiveness, Christians have a special gift of joy in their lives that cannot  be ignored. Out of this spiritual discovery many revival Christians have  volunteered to leave their jobs and work for the Church as evangelists and  ministers. [25]
>

Kibira knew that  Africa faced major need in the areas of food security, migratory labor, women&rsquo;s  and family problems, healthcare, and education. For Kibira, a highly motivated  and spiritually charged Church could use its energies to build diaconal, or  service, ministries in all of these areas. He wrote, &ldquo;The church has the  responsibility to preach the Gospel to all. But after that it will find that it  cannot escape being busy with people. To uplift them, to change their ethnics  for the better and to dress their wounds, to feed the hungry and others.&rdquo; [26]

Yet for all of the energy that revival  gave to the Churches, it posed still yet another a threat. Sometimes revivals  led to theological ideas and practices that fell outside of the Christian  tradition and divided the body of Christian believers. Therefore, the revival  and the established Church had a lot to gain from each other. As Kibira wrote, &ldquo;The  principle task confronting the official Church is the willingness to listen to  the revival. It is only in this was that well-trained theologians will be able  to offer their constructive criticism of the revival.&rdquo; [27] Thus, at the Addis  Ababa conference, Kibira was able to see the potential and the dangers of  various streams of Christian thought in the 20th century. From his  position at the confluence of the local and global church, he wanted to put  these different strands into engagement with each other. This engagement was  not always going to be easy. In fact, it could lead to considerable tension.  But the tension itself served a constructive purpose for the whole church. The  different strands of Christian thought each had something to offer the whole  body, and they each served to check the potential dangers of the other.

Kibira&rsquo;s ideas were so well  received that he was asked to lead opening worship at the Uppsala Cathedral at  the 1968 meeting of the World Council of Churches. His reputation also quickly  advanced within Lutheran circles. In 1970, Kibira was elected chairman of the  Commission on Church Cooperation for the Lutheran World Federation General  Assembly. Perhaps the greatest honor came, however, when Kibira was elected  President of the Lutheran World Federation in 1977. He was the first African to  hold the position. It was an exciting moment for African Lutherans and a great  honor to the Lutheran Church in Tanzania. The President of Tanzania, Julius  Nyerere, was so pleased with Kibira that he called a state banquet in the  Bishop&rsquo;s honor. As President of the LWF, Kibira worked tirelessly to keep  ecumenism, social justice, and faithful discipleship on the federation&rsquo;s  agenda. He held the post until 1984. [28]

Josiah Kibira died in 1988 after  suffering from Parkinson&rsquo;s disease. It was a great loss for both the church in  Africa and the world. Kibira was born in a small village by the banks of Lake  Victoria, and he eventually died there. Yet during his life, he was part of a  global movement, and found himself learning from and leading people in Asia,  Africa, Europe, Latin America, and North America. His life witnessed to the  fundamental nature of the Christianity in the 20th century—it was  both local and global. Kibira was no stranger to the tension of multiple  localities being brought into one universal body. As the recent debates over  homosexuality in the Anglican Communion demonstrate, local practice, interpretations  of scripture, and traditions can lead to conflict at the global level. Yet  rather than view these tensions as inevitable points of fracture and schism,  Kibira&rsquo;s theology allows for the tensions between local bodies to be  constructive at a global level; he showed one could embrace the history and  tradition of both church and society, while at the same time exploring new  possibilities. Ultimately, Jesus is the focal point of this ecclesiology. The  image is almost Eucharistic: the world Church comprises many different people,  who often hold radically different views; nevertheless, they all gather at the  table around Christ, sharing their experiences, and learning from each other.  Looking forward into the 21st century, Kibira&rsquo;s theology provides an  excellent blueprint for a world Church. It is not a church without conflict. It  is not a church that ignores various members of the body. It is a radically  inclusive space, where all are expected to be true to themselves, and all are  asked to be humble and learn from each other.
