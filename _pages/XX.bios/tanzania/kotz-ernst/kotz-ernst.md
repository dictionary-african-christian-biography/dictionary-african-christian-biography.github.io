Ernst Kotz was born at Strombach near Gummersbach, Germany, on February 11, 1887. He did some theological studies at Friedensau Mission School near Magdeburg, the Seventh-day Adventist college for Central Europe at that time. In preparation for his missionary service in what was then called German East Africa, he studied with Carl Meinhof and Felix von Luschan at the Oriental Seminar in Berlin for one year.

Arriving in Africa in July 1905, he was assigned to the South Pare Mountains where the denomination had one mission station and planned to erect others. Kotz started to work on the Asu (Southern Pare) language immediately after his arrival. Because of his outstanding language abilities that were soon recognized by his colleagues, language work became his special assignment in 1909. From April 1910 on, Kotz served as director of the Pare field.

Among the missionaries, much of the early translation work into Pare was his responsibility. In cooperation with Petro Risase and Anderea Senamwaye, he was instrumental in writing a grammar manual and in translating a primer, a hymnal, the Gospel according to Matthew, an Old Testament story book, and finally the New Testament. In addition, Kotz launched a periodical called *Mbirikizi* ("Preacher"). Matthew's Gospel, which was issued in 1910, was the first translation of a portion of the Bible ever published by a Seventh-day Adventist. Kotz's language work made a significant impact on the denomination as a whole by stimulating similar activities in other Adventist missions, particularly in Eastern Africa, where Adventists soon participated in Bible translations into Luo, Gusii, Kinyarwanda, and Jita.

On the practical level, Kotz was involved in various lines of missionary work, mainly at Kihurio. Kihurio was the most successful area for Adventist operations before World War I, and the mission administration was also located there. For a considerable time before Christianity was brought there by Seventh-day Adventists, this large village at the southeastern end of the Pare Mountains had been under a variety of influences, including Islam and non-Pare people groups such as the Sambaa, the Zigua, the Maasai, and the Nyamwezi. This may explain why in the pre-war years Kihurio emerged as the largest Adventist congregation with almost 100 members; moreover, half of the teachers came from the place where Kotz was the major missionary personality. After realizing that religious debates with Muslims did not yield any significant outcome in their conversion to Christianity, Kotz's strategy was to prevent as many persons as possible from becoming Muslims by building a "bulwark" of Christianity at Kihurio.

Under Kotz's leadership, the Adventist education network in Pare expanded to twenty-eight teachers and 2,300 pupils among a population of 20,000. After the first baptism in 1908, membership numbers reached 250 in 1914. A peculiar aspect of Adventist missionary operations in Tanzania that should also be mentioned is the acceptance of "spheres of influence." For the sake of orderly educational work, Kotz helped negotiate a partial comity agreement with the neighboring Leipzig Mission.

Kotz was outstanding among the Seventh-day Adventist missionaries of that period in that he was the only one who showed such a deep interest in ethnography, demonstrated in his books on the Pare, *Im Banne der Furcht* ("Under the ban of fear") and *Sklaven* ("Slaves"). Although the titles betray his critical view of many elements of traditional culture, his overall perspective of Pare life is realistic and reveals much appreciation for the culture--for example, traditional Pare law and economy. He insisted that the African is capable of being a "philosopher, poet, and thinker" (the title of one chapter in *Sklaven*) and declared that Europeans could learn a lot for their own parliamentary sessions from the patience and respect governing Pare courts. Moreover, at a time when some degree of racism was common even among missionaries, he declared that Andrea Senamwaye, one of the earliest converts, was a real friend to him. Considering the absence of other anthropological works by Adventist missionaries until more than a generation later, Kotz's sympathetic approach to the Pare must be viewed as exceptional.

At the same time, Kotz was cautious enough not to idealize traditional culture. He attacked the idea that Africans were "happy children of nature" in view of many Pare practices which, according to him, were dictated by fear rather than by harmony with creation. Against what he viewed as the tendency of over-appreciating "folkhood," he warned, "If one tries, as a missionary, to sustain the folk identity of the Pare man, one will, unfortunately, experience again and again that one can take over into Christianity only a very small remainder of his customs and practices because his whole doing and thinking is completely dipped in pagan religious and superstitious ideas." (*Im Banne der Furcht*, p. 203)

Kotz believed that a time might come when, among the Pare "everything has become new, and still the people will not have lost their identity in language and character. Only the ugly and the mean have had to cede." (*Sklaven*, p. 182) Thus, he envisioned a transformation of culture through a Christian remnant of converted individuals. By imagining an African Adventist folk church, he went beyond the missionary model within which his denomination often operated--the formation of religious minority communities.

World War I halted the thriving Adventist activities in Pare,
and in 1917, Kotz was interned in India and Egypt together
with most of his fellow missionaries. His wife, Hilde Kotz,
held the semi-official leadership of the whole Pare field
in the absence of her husband until she was repatriated with
most Germans in 1918-1919. After a short time of studying
at a university in Germany in 1920, Kotz climbed the ranks
of church hierarchy and became European Foreign Missions Secretary
then an Associate Secretary of the General Conference, and
finally the Secretary of the General Conference. From this
post he resigned in 1933 and  left the denomination.
Thus, although he had been elected president of the Central
European Division in 1933, this call was not implemented.
His two sons Hans and Siegfried, however, continued to serve
the denomination as missionaries in Africa, and his daughter
Ilse also remained a church member.

He died in Berlin on September 27, 1944. In spite of his tragic separation from the church that he had loved, Kotz has been justly called "one of the most gifted Africa missionaries that Adventism had brought forth" (D. Heinz).
