Edward Coode Hore was a London Missionary Society (LMS) missionary in Central Africa. Hore was part of that band of missionaries whose public protests resulted in the collapse of the slave trade in Central Africa and in the creation of Northern Rhodesia (Zambia). He was born at Frizinghall, near Bradford, Australia, and became a member of the Mariner's Church in Sydney. He was appointed to the Lake Tanganyika mission of the LMS, arriving in Zanzibar on August 1, 1877. Credentialed as a master mariner, he captained first the *Morning Star*, a 32-foot lifeboat, and later the *Good News*, a 54-foot, two-masted screw steam yacht financed by Robert Arthington of Leeds and dragged overland piece by piece for reassembly on Lake Tanganyika. In 1888, ill health dictated his taking a medical leave in England. Hore resumed his association with the LMS in 1892, serving as first officer on the Polynesian-based barque John Williams until his resignation in 1900. He settled in Tasmania, where he died at the age of 64.
