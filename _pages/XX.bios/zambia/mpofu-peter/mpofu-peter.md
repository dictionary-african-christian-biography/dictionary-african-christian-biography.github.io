Pioneer national worker. In 1899, five years after the founding of Solusi Mission, Pastor Mpofu began service with the mission as a teacher and evangelist. With overseas pioneers, he was instrumental in establishing mission work in parts of Rhodesia and Zambia, accompanying Pastor W. H. Anderson on many safaris into unentered territory. He passed to his rest at 103 years of age.
