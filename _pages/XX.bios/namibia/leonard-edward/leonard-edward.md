Reverend Edward Johannes Leonard was the spiritual father of the white Afrikaner settlers during three political periods: the end of the German colonial period (1910-1916), the South African military authority (1916-1919) and the South African Administration of Namibia (1919-1939).

His ministry started when he settled at Gibeon in 1910, serving the Afrikaners in all parts of Namibia, except Grootfontein.  By 1911, he settled in Windhoek, which was more central.  His ministry lasted for twenty-nine years without interruption.  By the time of his death in 1939, there were seven Dutch Reformed Church (DRC) congregations in Namibia.

For the first ten years he was the only DRC pastor in the country, travelling extensively to visit Afrikaner farmers (DRC members) in all parts of the country, from Warmbad in the south, to Grootfontein in the north.  For many years he was the personification of the DRC in Namibia.  Nieuwoudt described his ministry as follows:

> He was the virtual personification of the DRC in this country.  He provided continuity to the ministry, and was the responsible and well-known flag-bearer of the church with heads of state, military authorities, other Christian Churches, and mission institutions - with Afrikaners, Germans, English, whites, blacks and coloureds.  He was the planner and founder of the organized development of the church (DRC). (Nieuwoudt 1979: 169-170)

Edward Leonard was born at Winburg, South Africa on January 21, 1884.  At the age of sixteen, he joined the war of the Afrikaners against the British in 1899-1902, often only referred to as the "Boer War."[1]  He was captured and deported as a prisoner of war to the island of St. Helena where he completed catechism and received a call to Christian mission.

During the war Leonard lost his whole family, except his father.  After the war, he had to study for his secondary school qualification at the Boeren Zending School in 1903 in Worcester, before he could enrol for training at the Missions Institute of the DRC at Wellington, South Africa in 1907 (Oosthuizen 1995: 34, 36).  In 1909, Leonard attended a missions conference where he learned of the spiritual need of the Afrikaners in German South West Africa.  The DRC of Richmond in the Cape, was willing to sponsor the young missionary for ministry in Namibia. On March 18, 1910 Leonard arrived in Gibeon at the age of twenty-six, still unmarried, for a ministry in the Gibeon church of the DRC, which covered the whole of Namibia.

In 1911 he moved to Windhoek, but continued to be the pastor of the same Gibeon "congregation." His ministry continued for eighteen years, until 1929, when the Gibeon congregation was divided into two local churches, Windhoek and Mariental (formerly Gibeon).  He remained pastor of the Gibeon congregation, and therefore moved to Mariental in 1929.   Leonard continued the ministry from Mariental for the final ten years of his life, until his death in 1939.

As from 1912 the whole Afrikaner community, scattered all over the country as rural farmers, was under the spiritual care of Rev. Leonard.  He had to travel constantly, preaching the gospel to scattered Afrikaner communities.  His work, executed under difficult circumstances, was a unifying factor, providing leadership, care and encouragement to a pioneer Afrikaner community.  Whenever he visited a specific outpost, his ministry would last for a long weekend of church celebrations, including catechism, mariages, pastoral counselling, preaching, baptism, and holy communion. These periodic church services and festivities became the focus point of white Afrikaners in Namibia.

Because Leonard was trained to be a missionary,  he was ordained in a different "office" than that of a pastor.  Consequently the title of *eerwaarde* was used for Leonard, and not the traditional title of *dominee* (reserved only for pastors).  His congregation appealed many times to the Cape synod, in order for Leonard to be ordained as pastor.  Only in 1932, after the 22 years of full time ministry, did the synod approve. From that year on, his office changed from "missionary" to "pastor" (from *eerwaarde* to *dominee*).[2]
