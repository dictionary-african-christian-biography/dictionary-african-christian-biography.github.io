Evangelist Gottlieb Murangi and Pastor Andreas Kukuri  were among the first Namibian leaders of the  Evangelical Lutheran Church in the Republic of Namibia (ELCRN) in the 20th century, who gradually took over the spiritual leadership from the Rhenish Missionary Society, and established an independent Lutheran denomination in central Namibia.  This denomination was slower in its drive towards independent church formation than its sister church, the ELCRN, which developed from the work of the Finnish Missionary Society in the northern regions.

Evangelist Gottlieb Murangi was from the Herero-speaking community and studied at the Augustineum training centre of the Rhenish Mission, re-established in 1922 at Okahandja, after its closure during World War I.   Murangi held the office of evangelist in the Mission Church from the early 1920s.  His ministry was before the time of ordained pastors.  The pastorate in the Rhenish Mission Church only became available to Namibians in 1948.  That year, the first five Namibians were ordained as Lutheran pastors of the Mission Church.  An independent synod of the ELCSWA (later ELCRN) was only established in 1957.

Pastor Andreas Kukuri was one the first  five pastors ordained in 1948.  He first studied the course for evangelists for eighteen months, then he had a period of practical ministry, before doing the pastoral course.   The first group of ELCRN pastors included Andreas Kukuri, Gottlob Mungunda, Bernard Kahiiko, Joshua Tjiurutue and Reinhard Ruzo.[1]

(More research is currently launched about the remarkable leadership of Murangi and Kukuri).

**Interviews & questionnaires**

Christians, N. C. 2002.  *Unpublished notes forwarded on request to Buys, on 22 May 2002.*  Rev. Nicholas Christians was the pastor of the Trinity AME Church in Keetmanshoop for an uninterrupted period of 43 years (1953 - 1997).  In 1998, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Wilberforce Institute of the AMEC in USA.

The photo of his ministry starting in that year in the "old location" was unfortunately too bad to use in this publication.

Witbooi, H. 2002.  *Interview of Buys with the honourable Dr. Hendrik Witbooi, in Windhoek, on the
