Pastor Winfried Ebers became synonymous with the consolidating of the German Evangelical Churches throughout Southern Africa.  He came to Windhoek in 1924, and set himself the task of reorganizing the German congregations of the GEC after the disruption of World War I.[1]  His most important achievement was the establishment of the *Deutschen Kirchenbundes in Süd und Südwestafrika* in 1926. At the first meeting of the Kirchenbundes on October 1, 1926, Pastor Ebers was elected as its first chairman and in January 1927 also as *Landespropst* of the GEC in Namibia.[2]  At the same time, he became the first editor of the *Heimat*, a monthly newsletter of the GEC, and, in 1930, the first editor of the annually published *Afrikanischer Heimatkalender*.  As editor of these periodicals, Ebers made sure that the GEC became the proper "home" for all Protestant Christian Germans of Namibia for many years, with a unique blend of Lutheranism and German patriotism.

When Pastor Ebers left Namibia in 1932, he was succeeded as *Landespropst* by Pastor G. Andreas Wackwitz for six years (1933-1939).  However, in 1939, Pastor K. F. Hoeflich became *Landespropst* for the amazing period of twenty-seven years (1939-1966).  World War II broke out two weeks after his arrival in Windhoek on August 15, 1939.  For the duration of the war, Pastor Hoeflich was interned by the South African government, together with the German missionaries who also served as pastors for the GEC (i.e. acting as German pastors). They were released only in December 1946.  Pastor Hoeflich described his remarkable ministry in the *Heimatkalander*. (Hoeflich 1961: 82-85) [3]

Nicholas Christians was the pastor of the Trinity AME Church in Keetmanshoop for an uninterrupted period of 43 years (1953 - 1997).  In 1998, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Wilberforce Institute of the AMEC in USA.
