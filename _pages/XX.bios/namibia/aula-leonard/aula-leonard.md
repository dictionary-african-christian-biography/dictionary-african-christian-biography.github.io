As the first indigenous bishop in the history of the church in Namibia, Dr. Leonard Nangolo Auala has a permanent position in any publication on Namibian church history.  Dr. Auala was born in 1908 in a Christian home.  After a period of contract labour at the diamond mines, he was trained as a teacher at Oniipa (1931-32).  He worked for two years as a teacher, before he furthered his teacher's training at Augustineum (1934).  He then taught for six years at the training institute of Oniipa.

In 1941, he was trained at Paulinum as an evangelist and was ordained in 1942.  He ministered to the congregation of Oniipa, while at the same time teaching at the training institute.  By 1949, he was trained as a pastor and became church board secretary for the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Namibia (ELCIN) in 1951.  In 1958, he was appointed supervisor of the Ondonga section of the ELCIN.  He later continued his theology studies in South Africa.  He soon started to attend international church meetings in Africa and Europe.

In 1960, Dr. Auala was elected moderator of the ELCIN synod and, in 1963, he became the first bishop in the history of the ELCIN.  In this capacity, he became a member of the executive council of the Lutheran World Federation (LWF).  In 1967, the University of Helsinki awarded him an honorary doctorate in theology (Shejavali 1970:206-109,  Kritzinger 1972:56-59).  In 1971, Bishop Auala was the author of the well-known "Open Letter" to the South African prime minister, compiled jointly with Pastor Gowaseb of the ELCRN.

In 1979, Bishop Auala retired and was succeeded by Pastor Kleopas Dumeni, who was the youth work leader in the ELCIN.  Pastor Dumeni became the second bishop of the ELCIN. Bishop Auala died on December 4, 1983.

Bishop Auala was honoured by all indigenous churches and by the Ovambo people in general as a father of the people and an outstanding national leader (Immanuel Jan. 1984:9, Kritzinger 1972: 295-296).  His "father figure" role must be understood against the background of the ELCIN, which was always a homogenous peoples' church, forming a united cultural and social community.  Since the previous century, the membership of the ELCIN had originated almost one hundred percent from the Ovambo speaking peoples in northern Namibia. The homogenous character of the Ovambo tribes was always fully reflected in the ELCIN membership.  The Ovambo area was never really disrupted by external political events such as the two World Wars.  As bishop of this denomination, which was the only spiritual "mother" of the Ovambo tribes, Bishop Auala was a spiritual father figure, a leader of his people.  His leadership was established at a time when many traditional tribal authorities (chiefs or kings) cooperated with colonial governments and were not fully trusted by the people.  This was the time when political parties became the new "voice of the people."

Bishop Auala often had deliberations with the South African government, representing his people from 1963 on.  In 1963, after the Odendaal Plan, implementing the apartheid system, was announced, Bishop Auala issued two memoranda to the South African government, one in 1964 and one in 1967. He often had discussions with the commissioner generals on social issues like contract labour and other community problems. As the "conscience of the rulers," Bishop Auala often travelled to Pretoria to warn against the consequences of apartheid (cf. the declaration to the prime minister of South Africa on August 18, 1971, Hellberg 1979:176, Buys 1983:304-307).

Bishop Auala was trusted by his people, and saw his own position as that of a "shepherd of the people,"--one who had to tend to their spiritual and material well-being.  He described his office to the South African prime minister as that of "a Sentry over the House of Israel" (Ezek. 33), who had to warn the government that his people were suffering injustice.

Dr. Auala was a leader with great personal charisma.  He was a prophet who witnessed with great sensitivity, prudence, and love for the truth.  He was buried with the fitting honours on December 10, 1983 at Oniipa.  An ecumenical homage service, attended by thousands, was held on February 4, 1984 in the ELCIN church, Katutura, Windhoek (Immanuel Jan-Mar.1984:9). [1]

Nicholas Christians was the pastor of the Trinity AME Church in Keetmanshoop for an uninterrupted period of 43 years (1953 - 1997).  In 1998, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Wilberforce Institute of the AMEC in USA.
