Prophet Thusnelda Hambuindja was born in 1923 in Namibia but grew up in Francistown, Botswana.  Her father was a Namibian and a member of the Lutheran Church.  He was transferred to Botswana for his job, which was to work on the roads.

At the age of thirty, Thusnelda was baptized at St. John's Apostolic Faith Mission (SJAFM) under the leadership of Prophet Jacob Mokgwetsi Motswaosele (nicknamed Mokaleng) of Matsiloye in Tati District, Botswana.  In 1960, she returned to Windhoek and joined  the "faith of St. John's" (Pöllitzer 1978:48) of Petrus Tjijombo.

After her arrival she worked with Prophet Petrus Tjijombo of the SJAFM for sixteen years (1960-1976) until 1977, when she founded her own independent church, St. Jacob's Apostolic Church. As in the ministries of the two above-mentioned prophets, the emphasis of her ministry was on ritual purity and healing.  Pöllitzer reported that a shield in her garden declared "No smoking."  Smoking, drinking alcohol, and dancing were prohibited in her church.  In her house were images of Catholic saints and pictures of Jesus.  A table was arranged as an altar.  She never attended any school but could read.  She had prayed for people's healing since her childhood.  She claimed that even bishop Peter Tjijombo had been healed of sickness by her prayers. [1]

**Interviews & questionnaires**

Christians, N. C. 2002.  *Unpublished notes forwarded on request to Buys, on 22 May 2002.*  Rev. Nicholas Christians was the pastor of the Trinity AME Church in Keetmanshoop for an uninterrupted period of 43 years (1953 - 1997).  In 1998, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Wilberforce Institute of the AMEC in USA.

The photo of his ministry starting in that year in the "old location" was unfortunately too bad to use in this publication.
