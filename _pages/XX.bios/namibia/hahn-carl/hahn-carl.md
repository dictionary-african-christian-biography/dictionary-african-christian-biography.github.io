Carl Hahn was a pioneer German missionary in Namibia. Born in Riga, Latvia, Hahn was converted as a young man and in 1842 was sent to South-West Africa (Namibia) by the Rhenish Mission. As a pioneer missionary, strongly supported by his English wife, Emma (Hone), he studied the language and compiled the first Herero grammar. After almost 20 years of fruitless missionary effort, he developed a small missionary community of laypeople and African Christians, a so-called mission colony at Otjimbingue, where he also opened a theological seminary in 1868. He invited the Finnish Missionary Society to take up mission work among the Ambo tribes in northern Namibia. During his missionary career Hahn developed a more decidedly Lutheran orientation and laid the foundations for the establishment of a Lutheran church in Namibia. In 1873 he left the mission and became the pastor of a German Lutheran Congregation in Cape Town, where he died.
