On January 27, 1979, Bonifatius (Bonnie) Hausiku became the first indigenous Roman Catholic bishop in Namibia.  His official title was "Titular Bishop of Troina" and "Wy-bishop of Windhoek."  His authority covered only the northern region, the vicariate of Windhoek.  In the southern region of the Keetmanshoop vicariate, Bishop Schlotterback was still in office.  The motto chosen by Bishop Hausiku was *Iustitiae et Pax* ("Justice and Peace").

Bishop Hausiku was born in 1933 at the Sambiu mission station (Kavango) where he completed his school education.  He received secondary education and seminary training in Lesotho and Hammanskraal (South Africa).  On June 29, 1966, he was ordained as priest in Windhoek by Bishop Koppmann and ministered for the first few years amongst his own people in Sambiu.  In 1974, he left Sambiu and became the leader of the well-known Andara mission station, East Kavango.  After four years at Andara, he was nominated by the pope as bishop (Angelus Nov.1978: app.2-3).  On January 27, 1979, he was ordained by Bishop Koppmann as bishop for Windhoek.  In March 1981, he was installed as first bishop for the vicariate of Windhoek (*CCN information* Apr. 1981:1).   Bishop Hausiku died in office in 2002.

**Interviews & questionnaires**

Christians, N. C. 2002.  *Unpublished notes forwarded on request to Buys, on 22 May 2002.*  Rev. Nicholas Christians was the pastor of the Trinity AME Church in Keetmanshoop for an uninterrupted period of 43 years (1953 - 1997).  In 1998, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Wilberforce Institute of the AMEC in USA.

The photo of his ministry starting in that year in the "old location" was unfortunately too bad to use in this publication.
