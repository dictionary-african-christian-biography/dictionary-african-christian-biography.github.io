![John McKendree Springer](\images\bio-pics\demrepcongo\springer-john\springer-john.jpg){:class="bio"}
John McKendree Springer was a founder of American Methodist Congo Mission, missionary explorer, and bishop. Springer sailed to Southern Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1901 as superintendent of the Old Umtali Industrial Mission. After marrying in 1905, he and his wife Helen Emily *Springer began forays into uncharted territory. Feeling called by God to fulfill the dreams of David Livingstone and William Taylor to found a chain of mission stations across central Africa, the Springers set off on foot from Northern Rhodesia (Zambia) to Angola despite mission board disapproval. Reaching the coast, they returned to the United States and Springer pressed for the establishment of a Congo Mission. After raising money, the Springers undertook an arduous two-year journey to found Methodist mission stations in the Congo (Zaire), including the Fox Bible Training School.

In 1915 the Congo Mission was formally approved, and Springer was its superintendent until 1936, except from 1921 to 1923, when he supervised Methodist work in Southern Rhodesia. Under him Protestant work was opened in Lunda country, in Katanga Province, and in other locations. In 1936 Springer was elected Methodist bishop for Africa. His belief in leadership training for the indigenous church caused him to work to establish higher education. After his retirement in 1944 he devoted himself to the Congo Institute he had founded in Mulungwishi, renamed the Springer Institute in his honor. He married another Congo missionary, Helen Everett, after the death of his first wife. They returned to the United States in 1963.
