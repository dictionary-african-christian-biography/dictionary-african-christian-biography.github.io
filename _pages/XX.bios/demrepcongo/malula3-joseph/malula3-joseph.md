Cardinal Joseph Malula was a leading Congolese Roman Catholic visionary  during the second half of the 20th century. During the days when  Mobutu proclaimed *authenticité* as a state policy, attempting to cast off  the colonial mentality, Malula was engaging in various practices of  inculturation, making the Roman Catholic Church authentically African.

**Family  and education background**


Joseph  Malula wrote more than 750 documents of which the majority have been compiled  and published in seven volumes by Leon de Saint Moulain (1997). Born in  Kinshasa on December 17, 1917, Joseph Malula was the fifth child out of eight.  He attended the Minor Seminary of Mbata-Kiela in Mayombe (Lower Congo  Province), the Minor Seminary of Bolongo, near Lisala (Equator region), and the  Major Seminary of Kabwe (Kasaï region).   Even if Malula did not attend university classes, two universities  granted him the title of *doctor honoris causa*, namely the Catholic  University of Leuven on February 2, 1978 and Boston College on March 18, 1980.

**Leadership**

Malula&rsquo;s  leadership skills started with his priestly ordination that was both an  ordinary and extraordinary event that happened on June 9, 1946 at Queen Astrid  Stadium in Kinshasa (later renamed the Stadium of November 24 to commemorate  Mobutu&rsquo;s political takeover). The priestly ordination was a normal event as the  culmination of Malula&rsquo;s training in both minor and major seminars. However, though  Stephane Kaoze was the first Congolese priest ordained in 1917 in Baudouinville  (Kirungu, Eastern Congo), the priestly ordination of Malula and his two  companions seems to have been a more significant event. It was attended by some  20,000 people, including Mayor Pierre Reykmans. [1] The latter was the Chief  Governor of Belgian Congo during the Second World War. [1b]

Following  this grandiose priestly ordination, Malula started building up his leadership  skills as a teacher at the Minor Seminary of Bokoro, before working as a vicar  and parish priest in Kinshasa (at Christ the King and Saint Peter Parishes). On  September 20, 1959, he was consecrated bishop at Tata Raphaël Stadium which was  later called the Stadium of May 20 to commemorate Mobutu&rsquo;s political party. Malula  considered his episcopal consecration as a great day during which God inspired  him to state: &ldquo;A Congolese Church in a Congolese State&rdquo; (cf. note 1). Some  years later, he recalled this statement and said: &ldquo;I did not realise the  influence of these words on my life and its great impact in the history of our  country.&rdquo; [2]

Step by  step, Malula acquired the leadership quality of a prophet, especially a prophet  of justice. In a speech given on January 4, 1969 in the presence of General  Mobutu, he pleaded for a distributive justice, which was being neglected by the  new regime. On June 29, 1970, before King Baudouin of Belgium and President  Mobutu, Malula denounced the luxurious life standards of the political leaders  at the expense of harmonious development.

On March 28,  1969, the Vatican announced the elevation of Joseph Malula as cardinal, and he  received the red biretta in Rome on April 28, 1969. He declared that this  elevation would determine his life less than the episcopal consecration. [3] On  January 16, 1972, he wrote a pastoral letter which was deemed subversive. The  media attacked him on January 22. On January 24, he was expelled from his  residence and obliged to go into exile in Rome from February 11 until June 28,  1972. Before the end of his life, he managed to organise one of the most  memorable events in his pastoral ministry, namely the Diocesan Synod of  1986-1988. Further details of his leadership achievements are highlighted in  the section on his impact.

**Impact**

Malula&rsquo;s  pastoral and leadership legacy is immense and diverse, ranging from his  empowerment of the Congolese personnel to manage his archdiocese, his liturgical  contributions, his pastoral care for the family and for intellectuals, and his  advocacy and charity work among the less privileged. [4]

If Joseph  Malula did not perform miraculous healings, he certainly prayed for the sick  and contributed to restoring the dignity of many marginalized people through  social actions and prayer. He acknowledged the importance of prayer in his  life, when he said: &ldquo;I am neither a theologian nor a mystic. I am simply a  person who prays or at least who tries to pray.&rdquo; [5] He questioned the Christian identity of  Kimbanguists in terms of invalid baptism, [6] as they baptize in the name of  Simon Kimbangu&rsquo;s metamorphosed sons. Nevertheless, he remained open to collaboration  with Kimbanguists and Protestants for the sake of solidarity and sharing. This  was illustrated in a lecture he presented in the Cathedral of Our Lady of  Lingwala (Kinshasa) on March 28, 1981 under the title: &ldquo;Christian Laity of  Today&rsquo;s Zaire (Protestants, Kimbanguists, and Catholics) Encouraged to Pursue Solidarity  and Sharing.&rdquo; Malula wanted to be not only a founder of a Congolese Church but  also a prophet of justice. He often repeated that he would rather be crucified  than crucify the truth. [7] A good number of the Congolese might certainly  agree that Malula lived, suffered, and died as a prophet of justice and truth.  An attentive tour of Kinshasa city will hardly fail to reveal Malula&rsquo;s legacy  as far as ecclesial and social structures are concerned, though those  structures have been adversely affected by lootings since the early 1990s. In  short, Malula&rsquo;s legacy supports his leadership commitment that consisted of  creating living conditions for a moderate, authentic Congolese Church in a  Congolese State.
