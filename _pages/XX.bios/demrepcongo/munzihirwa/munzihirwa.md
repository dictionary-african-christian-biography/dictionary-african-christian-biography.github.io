Munzihirwa was born in 1926 in Lukumba, located in the  northeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo [DRC]. The name  &ldquo;Munzihirwa&rdquo; means &ldquo;leader,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mwene Ngabo&rdquo; means &ldquo;son of the people.&rdquo; His  surname of &ldquo;Muhudumu&rdquo; means &ldquo;servant of God&rdquo; in Kiswahili.

Munzihirwa was a brilliant stand-out during his many years  of study, years into which his pastoral ministry was often interwoven. After  his general Greco-Latin studies at the minor seminary of Mugeri, he began his  theological studies at the major seminary of Nyakubanda in Rwanda but continued  them at Moba in the DRC. Upon completion, he was ordained priest for the  diocese of Bukavu in 1958. He later became priest and dean of the cathedral  parish of Bukavu.

In keeping with the best Jesuit tradition, Munzihirwa was ever  focused on his formation. From 1965-66, he pursued his theological studies at  the Institut de Philosophie de Saint-Pierre Canisius [St. Peter Canisius Institute  for Philosophy] in Kimwenza. From 1967-69 he studied social sciences and  economics. Several years later (in 1977), his interest in these areas led him  to earn his PhD in sociology.

After finishing his studies, Munzihirwa became vicar of the  university parish of Kinshasa where, in a show of solidarity with the students  who were forcibly conscripted into the army in 1971, he voluntarily chose to  share their lot and enlisted as well. Shortly thereafter, his rise through the  Jesuit ranks began. By turns, he was named Vicar Superior of the Jesuit student  house at the University of Lubumbashi, then Rector of the St. Peter Canisius  Institute for Philosophy in 1978. In 1980, he was named Superior (Provincial)  of the Jesuit Province of Central Africa, which included Rwanda, Burundi, and  the DRC. [In 1986], he was appointed coadjutor bishop to Monsignor Pirigisha of  the Kasongo Diocese. Following this, he became Apostolic Administrator of the Bukavu  archdiocese in 1993 and its archbishop in 1994.

The heart of his ministry began in 1994, and it consisted  above all in defending the oppressed by striving for peace, justice, and truth.  During the last two years of his life, he was deeply involved in the peace  process for the Great Lakes region, an area that had been ravaged by civil war.

Monsignor Munzihirwa was a towering figure in the Church&rsquo;s  life in the DRC, and his influence was felt outside of the country&rsquo;s borders as  well. His involvement as a committed Christian serves as a model for all those  of the region who seek to serve God. While actively engaged in the area&rsquo;s peace  process, Munzihirwa was assassinated by Rwandan soldiers on October 29, 1996.
