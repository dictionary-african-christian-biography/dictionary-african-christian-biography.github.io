Jean Ifoto  Bokambanza Bokeleale was a leader in the Church of Christ in Congo. He was a  leader from the Disciples of Christ who worked during the Mobutu regime to form  a single protestant church in Zaire, L'Église du  Christ au Zaïre. He was a talented scholar and bold visionary, but not all  protestants shared his particular vision for unity.

**Family,  education and pastoral ministry**

Bokeleale  wrote some letters, but very little has been written on his life and  ministry.  According to the *Dictionary of African Biography*, Bokeleale  was born around 1920 near the town of Becimbola, in the vicinity of Lotumbe  town, northwest Equateur region. Other sources place this birth on December 23,  1919 at Bompoma, near Djombo, Equateur region. He was the second child of his  mother Mputu, one of his father Mbomba&rsquo;s four wives. After attending primary  and secondary schools, he worked as a teacher at the Christian Institute of  Congo in Bolenge. He married Amba Bokaa, and the couple had seven children.

One year  after his appointment as an assistant pastor at Ikongo in 1936, Bokeleale met Pastor  Jean Bomenge who persuaded him to enter the Disciples of Christ primary school  in 1937 in Lotumbe. He completed the four-year program within two years and  joined the Congo Christian Institute at Bolenge for his secondary education,  which he finished in 1942 with distinction. He was ordained a pastor on August 24,  1956. From the late fifties or from 1961 to 1963, he studied at the Faculty of  Protestant Theology of Brussels and got a Master&rsquo;s degree (licence) in  theology. Back in the DRC, he entertained strong ties with the American  counterparts of Disciples of Christ not only through frequent trips to USA, but  also during his training in public administration in that country. He received  his doctorate *honoris causa* from the Christian  Theological Seminary of Indianapolis.

**Leadership**

Bokeleale&rsquo;s  leadership ability was noticed throughout his education because he scored high  marks and completed a study program within half the required time. In the late  1950s, Disciples of Christ missionaries saw in him as &ldquo;a major leader of an  African-led church.&rdquo; [1] As a matter of fact, he progressively occupied  several leadership positions. After his theological studies in 1963, &ldquo;twelve  young elders of the Disciples of Christ anxious to assert African leadership  over the continuing American missionary presence chose to elect Bokeleale as  the head of the Disciples of Christ in Congo.&rdquo; [2] When Mobutu took power in  1965, he sought more support from Protestant church leaders. Bokeleale availed  himself as Mobutu&rsquo;s ally and adviser while using this opportunity to  consolidate his authority over Protestant churches and promote the authenticity  movement even through its Mobutist version called the philosophy of  authenticity.

According to  one of his entourage who was interviewed by a journalist in 1974, the  authenticity campaign allowed the Congolese people to recover their true being  and their deep ethos. [3] This was also  the year when the authenticity campaign reached a climax as Verkys Vévé  Kiamungana Mateta launched his revolutionary song &ldquo;Nakomitunaka&rdquo; (I keep asking  myself). In a certain sense, it echoed the 1956 book *Les prêtres noirs s&rsquo;interrogent* (Black priests are wondering).  The song interrogated God about the origin of black people pointing out that  Adam and Eve, Jesus, Mary and Joseph are represented as whites. All the saints  are also seen as white while only devils are represented as blacks. Black  symbols and prophets are rejected or put in the same category as witchcraft, in  contrast with the white ones. It is strange that Verkys Vévé was forced into  exile while the authenticity movement champions were in command of state affairs  and church politics both on Catholic and Protestant fronts.

In 1975,  Bokeleale requested that the synod of the Church of Christ in Congo consider  ordaining some of the leaders as bishops. In spite of the refusal of the synod  and the indignation of the majority of Protestant churches at that time, Bokeleale  was elected in 1968 as the General Secretary of the Protestant Council in Congo.  Two years later, he became the first chairperson of the Church of Christ in  Congo. He was consecrated bishop on May 16, 1977, despite strong opposition  from the Protestant elite in Congo. In 1979, he extended this authority to  Disciples of Christ Church leaders by raising their social conditions and reaching  Christians at the grassroots through social actions such as schools or women&rsquo;s  associations.

**Impact**

During  Bokeleale&rsquo;s leadership, the Church of Christ in Congo took many initiatives in  the field of socio-economic growth. It increased its participation in the education  sector, in health, social development, micro-finance, and business enterprises  like industrial fishing and printing.

Bokeleale  will be remembered for having directed the unification of Protestants in the DRC  and for introducing the episcopal system into Protestant church structures. However,  due to strong opposition to its introduction, the episcopal system has weakened  the unity of Protestant churches in Congo. Some of the Protestant elite  wondered whether Christ was still the head of the Church of Christ in Congo.  Presently, the episcopal system is being accepted even by those who objected to  it during Bokeleale&rsquo;s time. Further research would be appropriate to determine  how this system is faring in consonance with an authentic Congolese Protestant  Church, according to the desires of Bokeleale and his close entourage.
