Pantaenus left no written indications of his own work or thought, but as first known head of the Christian philosophical or catechetical school at Alexandria, he made an unmistakable impact upon the development of church theology.  The direct succession from him provides the source of information.  Clement's (c. 150-215) metaphor of the "Sicilian bee" makes probable his place of origin, though he has also been called the "Samaritan Stoic"; his Christianity had taken him as missionary evangelist as far east as India.

He is dated by the direct role he played as teacher of Clement who succeeded him, of Alexander (d. 250) who studied under them both and was later bishop of Cappadocia and then of Jerusalem (Aelia), and of Origen (c. 185-254) who may have been too young to have been taught directly by him but whose martyred father, Leonides (d. c. 202/203), was Pantaenus' contemporary and of like mind.  His philosophy was Stoicism and his literary interests were classical; considering the exegetical writings of his successors, this would account not only for their strong emphasis upon a divine literature, but also for their allegorical methodology in interpreting the same.
