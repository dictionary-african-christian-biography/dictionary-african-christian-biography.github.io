Born of pagan parents in Upper Egypt, this most important of the early Coptic saints came in contact with a local Christian community that befriended him while he was a conscript in the Roman army in 312. When he was taken prisoner, they brought him food and provided support and friendship, and in turn Pachomius became a Christian and devoted his life to helping others. [1]

After he had completed his army service, Pachomius settled in a small community, was baptized, and began a life of regular prayer, fasting, and almsgiving. Eventually he organized a monastic *koinonia* (community) based on mutual service and sharing among members. The idea caught hold, and by the time of Pachomius's death in 346, it had grown to more than five thousand monks in nine monasteries and two convents of nuns. This idea of a carefully organized Christian community praying together several times a day and then going about individual or group tasks was in sharp contrast to the equally popular practice of monks becoming hermits and living alone in desert places.

The monastic communities (including the convents run by the sister of Pachomius) were based on a constantly evolving rule, which the founder extracted from New Testament teachings of Jesus. It contained a heavy teaching component, and the superior of a monastery, the house master, or another monk were expected to lead Bible study several times a week, on feast days, and at the annual gathering of monks near the year's end. The rule also included total obedience to superiors and common ownership of all property.

The goal was to organize a large group of unruly people into an efficient, effective praying and working community, and to do this Pachomius borrowed on the Roman military forms of organization he had been exposed to as a youth. He thus shaped the new Christian community into an economically and spiritually viable organization of several thousand members in an agriculturally unproductive region filled with hostile peoples.
