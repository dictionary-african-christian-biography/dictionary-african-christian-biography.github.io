Athanasius, Patriarch of Alexandria, was the anti-Arian bishop of Alexandria. He taught and consecrated Frumentius (*Abba* Sälama) as first bishop of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church about 330 A.D. During the second period of his persecution by the Roman Emperor Constantinus, acting on the instigation of Arian bishops, Athanasius is thought of have made his way to Ethiopia from the Libyan desert where he had made his refuge about 356-61. He is venerated as a saint. He wrote many works, and one of the well-known Ethiopian anaphoras is attributed to him.
