On the Upper Nile north of Thebes where the prevailing flow is east to west is the ancient center of Coptic Christianity.  About 350 Pgol established an important cenobitic community, the White Monastery, based on the Rule of Pachomius (c. 290-346), near Sohag (Athribis/Atripe), some fifty miles downstream from Nag Hammadi, the source of Coptic Gnostic papyri.  Administration passed from Pgol to his nephew Shenoute some time before 388.

Of this man there remains a considerable volume of expository epistles and sermons -- nearly half unpublished, those published undergoing Coptological reediting -- and for his life several accounts, the oldest by his pupil and successor, Besa, which describe his severe temperament besides organizational abilities.  Shenoute was present at the Council of Ephesus (431 -- he dates his ministry from some 43 years prior) and influential upon that of Chalcedon (451 -- having aided the Church against both Gnosticism and Monophysitism).  He may have lived as late as 466; the tradition ascribes to him the inordinately long life of 118 years.
