Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada,  Rev. Herbert E Randall was, first of all, a Holiness  Movement Church  missionary in Asyut, and then a Pentecostal  missionary in Cairo.  Randall was born into a Methodist family in Eastern Canada.  As a young man living in Ottawa he came under the influence of Methodist  revivalist Rev. Ralph Horner and through his ministry came to vital Christian  faith. In 1895 Horner was deposed from ministry in the Methodist Church  for refusing to take a pastoral charge. Within months he birthed The Holiness  Movement Church, based in Ottawa,   Canada. Herbert  Randall was the first missionary of this new movement with assignment to Egypt, where he  arrived in April 1899.

Randall ministered in Asyut (370 kms south of Cairo) and  surrounding region from 1899 to 1906. Egyptian Christian Salib Boulos described  Randall&rsquo;s ministry approach: &ldquo;A tall, rather slender young Canadian, clothed in  black apparel from head to foot, with a brown beard, walked the streets of Assiout  with Bible and song book under his arm, holding meetings. These meetings were mostly  attended by children sitting down on spread mats brought from their homes for the  occasion, and ladies looking down from their attics.&rdquo;

Joined  shortly by other Canadian HMC missionaries, Randall was the worker who moved to  initiate new outstations in the surrounding region. Upon arrival in Egypt he was  initially taken up with the notion of reaching Muslims for Christ, however, it  appears that he soon diverted his mission to &ldquo;the low-hanging fruit&rdquo; of Coptic  Christians who desired a new experience of the spiritual life.

Following  a return to Canada in 1906,  Randall experienced the Pentecostal &lsquo;baptism in the Spirit&rsquo; in Toronto  and became a key figure in the early development of Pentecostalism in Canada  (1907-1911). Returning with new vigor to Egypt in 1912, Randall joined a small  group of Pentecostal missionaries, as the &lsquo;experienced missionary,&rsquo; in founding  The Pentecostal Church. He was involved in planting their first church in  central Cairo, and for years produced an Arabic  language magazine, *The Morning Star*,  that was distributed throughout North Africa and the Middle   East.

Aside  from a brief time period back in Canada  (1915-1922) when he married Faith Proudfoot at age 50, Randall served in Egypt until his death in Egypt in 1938,  at 72 years of age.

In  1959, The Holiness Movement Church in Canada  and Egypt  merged with The Free Methodist Church. Today, the Free Methodists in Egypt are  the third largest Protestant denomination with more than 45,000 believers and  105 congregations. The Pentecostal   Church eventually became  part of the Assemblies of God international family in 1914. The Assemblies of  God is the second largest Protestant denomination with 130 congregations and  almost 200,000 believers.
