Dominican missiologist.

De Menasce was born in Alexandria, Egypt, of a Jewish father, and was educated in law and philosophy in Alexandria and Cairo and at Oxford. He was secretary of the Zionist Bureau in Geneva in 1925 when he converted to Catholicism. He was baptized in 1926 in Paris. Louis Massignon encouraged him to undertake Syriac studies; this was the beginning of his outstanding contribution to Oriental studies. In 1930 he joined the Dominicans and was ordained to the priesthood in 1935. From 1936 he taught history of religions and missiology at the University of Fribourg, Switzerland. He was instrumental in the creation, in 1945, of the multilingual Nouvelle Revue de Science Missionaire/Neue Zeitschrift fur Missionswissenechaft, edited by Johannes Beckmann. In 1939 he was appointed research professor of the religions of ancient Iran in Paris. Disabled by strokes in 1957 and 1967, he was still very active in writing and correspondence until his death in Paris. He had affinities with the neo-Thomist revival led by Jacques Maritain and Charles Journet, but his closest links were with Massignon, Abd-el Jalil, Louis Gardet, and other Islamists. The relationship of Christianity to Judaism, Islam, and all the great world religions was central to his missiology, and in this he agreed emphatically with the theology of Hendrik Kraemer. In all this he contributed to the theological renewal of Roman Catholic missiology after World War II.
