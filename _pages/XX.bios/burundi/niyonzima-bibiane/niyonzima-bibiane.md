Bibiane was born at Giheta on May 15, 1978. Less than two months after her birth, her parents brought her to the parish church of Murayi for baptism. Despite her parents’ wishes to the contrary, Bibiane decided to end her education upon completing elementary school. She felt a greater attraction to the rural life than to the academic one.

Even from her youth, Bibiane’s Christian faith and her devotion to the Blessed Virgin shone in her daily life. She walked eight kilometers [five miles] every day to attend Mass. She joined the Legion of Mary where she served in a variety of positions. She was known to be very trustworthy.

Bibiane’s marriage to Méthode Makintije was celebrated on September 9, 1996 during the civil war- a period that soon claimed her as a victim. An eyewitness to her final moments recounts the story:
>
> As I was walking along the road around 6 PM, I heard a lot of noise
> and then, distinctly, the voices of three people: two men (a uniformed
> soldier and a civilian) and a very young woman. The soldier was intent
> on disrobing the woman. He stripped her completely, even including
> her undergarments. She struggled and cried at the top of her voice:
> ‘It is useless to force me, you can’t make me, I will never give in to
> you! I will never commit adultery!’ The civilian, whose name was
> Alexis, did everything he could to get the woman out of the soldier’s
> grasp. Thwarted, the soldier became enraged and fired a bullet that
> hit both victims at the same time. Bibiane died on the spot, whereas
> Alexis’ leg was shattered.
>
>
>
> Experiencing a moment of regret, the soldier tried to bandage Alexis’
> wound with a piece of the woman’s clothing. Alexis refused. Instead,
> he stated that he wished to meet the same fate as the woman. In a blind
> rage, the soldier fired two shots at Alexis, killed him, and then stabbed
> the bodies of his two victims over and over again with his bayonet. He dragged the bodies off the Gitega-Bujumbura road and dumped them
> into a ditch.

It was thus that these two Christians testified to their faith. Bibiane was a martyr of chastity whereas Alexis was a martyr of charity.
