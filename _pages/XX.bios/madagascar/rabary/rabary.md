Rabary was a Malagasy teacher and writer. He was a second-generation
Christian of noble descent. His family lived in different
villages of the central part of Madagascar due to the demands
of his evangelist father's work. He was the youngest pupil
to be admitted to the London Missionary Society normal school
in 1876 and to the local medical school four years later.
He experienced a spiritual crisis and thought he would find
comfort in Catholicism, but kept the matter secret and lived
in torment for some time. His father's recommendation on his
deathbed in 1879 guided his choice: Rabary was to succeed
his father and pastor and evangelist. His studies were interrupted
when he was called to join the courtiers' circle of Queen
Ranavalona II, but in 1882 one of the pastors of the palace
church urged him to become a teacher.

Rabary taught various subjects in different schools and circumstances while pursuing his studies with the assistance of missionaries. He became one of the first Malagasy to study in France, going to Paris in 1896, but stayed only for a few months. In 1900 he became pastor of the church of Avaratr'Andohalo but continued to teach and began to write. As a member of a patriotic movement against French colonization, he was imprisoned in 1915 and exiled from the capital from 1916 to 1918. His literary works covered many fields. Rabary is mainly remembered for his accounts of the progress of Christianity-more precisely of Protestantism-in Madagascar. His first book, *Ny Maritiora Malagasy* (Malagasy martyrs), appeared in 1910. A celebration of his achievements took place on his eightieth birthday, followed by others after his death.
