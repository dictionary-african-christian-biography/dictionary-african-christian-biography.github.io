S. E. Jörgensen was born in Tromöy, Norway, on October 23, 1846. After five years of theological studies at the University of Christiania (now, of Oslo), he was ordained as a pastor in the Lutheran Church in 1874. The following year he left for Madagascar, sent out by the Lutheran Norwegian Missionary Society (NMS) to direct the Lutheran seminary there. He stayed in that position for nine years, and also directed the missionary press. In addition, he was the editor-in-chief of *Ny Mpamangy* [The Visitor], a monthly journal of the Malagasy Lutheran Church.

Jörgensen was a prolific writer, whether writing in Norwegian, in English, or, most of all, in Malagasy. His scientific articles were published in the review (the *Antananarivo Annual*) that was printed by his colleagues from the London Missionary Society, J. Sibree and R. Baron. His writings in Malagasy dealt mostly with theology and missionary concerns.

In 1886 he returned to Norway, where he taught in the NMS seminary in Stavanger, starting in 1889. In 1892, he was named director of the seminary, and from 1897 to 1915, he was a pastor in Trondheim. It was during those years that he wrote a number of articles on Madagascar and missions.

Jörgensen died in Risör on October 26, 1937.
