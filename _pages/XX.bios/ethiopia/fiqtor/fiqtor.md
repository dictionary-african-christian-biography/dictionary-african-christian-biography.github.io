Fiqtor, *Abba*, was a false monk, said to be from Syria, who deposed *Abunä* Pétros in the first half of the tenth century by means of forged letters from the Patriarch Cosmas, in office 921-933 A.D. According to some accounts Fiqtor set his accomplice Minas as *abun* in Pétros' place, and ensured that the reigning prince, sometimes identified as Del-Nä'ad, was deposed and replaced for a time by his elder brother, tentatively identified as Emperor 'Anbässa-Wedem. Later Fiqtor quarreled with Minas, robbed his house and fled to Egypt, where he became a Muslim and spent his days in riotous living.
