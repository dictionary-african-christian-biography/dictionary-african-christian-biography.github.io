Hezb&auml;-Bar&auml;k, (perhaps fl. c. 8th or 9th century A.D.), was an ancestor of St. Täklä-Haymanot, and is said to have lived a few generations after the Emperors 'Abreha and 'Asbeha. He reputedly moved from Tegré to Amhara, where he settled in Dawent. His son Täklä-Qä'at married a woman of Mäqdäla in Amhara, and their son, Abba 'Asqä-Léwi, was responsible for spreading the Gospel widely in the area. The historicity of these characters is perhaps not to be taken very seriously, but their activities probably reflect a genuine southwards movement of Aksumite influence round about the eighth century, when Islam had isolated Aksum from her former contacts in Egypt and Constantinople.
