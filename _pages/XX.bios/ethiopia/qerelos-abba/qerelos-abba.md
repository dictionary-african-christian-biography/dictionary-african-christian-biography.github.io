Q&eacute;relos, or G&eacute;relos, *Abba*, was the bishop, or *pappas*, "in the country of Amhara, during the Zagwé kingdom," who first made St. Täklä-Haymanot a deacon, "in the days when *Abba* Benyamin was Archbishop of Alexandria."

A reference to an archbishop, or *liqä-pappasat* Qérelos, appears in a land grant given by Emperor Yekuno-'Amlak in 1269/70. Other references to the same person are found in unpublished MSS. of the *Gädlä Zéna-Marqos* and *Gädlä Qäwestos* at Däbrä Libanos.
