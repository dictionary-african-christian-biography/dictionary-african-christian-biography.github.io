'Egzi'e-Har&auml;ya (perhaps fl. 13th century A.D.), was the mother of St. Täklä-Haymanot. When her husband, Säga-Zä-'Ab, escaped from Selales (Bulga) and the persecution of the pagan governor of Damot, Motälamé, she was captured and taken to the governor, who desired to marry her. The intervention of the Archangel Mika'él saved her, and she was carried off and reunited with Säga-Zä-'Ab in Zoräré, in Säwa, where their son was conceived and born.
