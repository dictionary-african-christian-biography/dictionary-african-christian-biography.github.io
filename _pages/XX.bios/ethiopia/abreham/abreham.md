'Abreham, *Abunä*, (? perhaps fl. c. 4th or 5th century A.D.), was, according to traditional sources, an early Bishop of Ethiopia of whom little appears to be remembered except for his name. In the list of Metropolitans published by Zotenberg he is placed as the third Bishop of Ethiopia, and successor of *Abunä* Minas, in place of *Abunä* Pétros, whose name occurs in other sources.

Richard K. P. Pankhurst
