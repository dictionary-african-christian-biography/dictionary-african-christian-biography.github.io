The Eunuch of Ethiopia, the treasurer of Queen Candace, was converted to Christianity through Philip the Deacon (Acts VIII, 26-40). Perhaps he was an "Ethiopian" Jew or an "Ethiopian" Jewish proselyte who had come to the Temple of Jerusalem to offer a gift. According to a tradition of the Ethiopian Church, he became the first Christian missionary to Ethiopia.
