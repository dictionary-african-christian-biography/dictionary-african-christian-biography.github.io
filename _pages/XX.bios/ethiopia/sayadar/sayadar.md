Sayadar b. Mahrawal was a legendary Christian king in the Harär area. Following the *Fath Madinat Harar*, an unpublished legendary history of Harär in the 13th century A.D., Sayadar was the last king of the infidels fighting against the Haräri under the leadership of their most important saint Abadir 'Umar ar-Rida and his followers. In the Fath, Sayadar is anachronistically designated as a "Portuguese." He succeeded his niece Markaniš after she had been killed in battle in 689 H. (1290 A.D.). He was defeated by the Haräri in 699 H. (1299 A.D.).
