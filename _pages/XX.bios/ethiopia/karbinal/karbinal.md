Karbin&acirc;l (or: Karniy&acirc;l, Karbit&acirc;l, Karn&icirc;l) b. Mahraw&acirc;l, was a legendary Christian king in the Harär area. Following the *Fath Madinat Harar*, an unpublished legendary history of Harär in the 13th century A.D., Karbinäl was the first king of the infidels who fought against the Haräri under the leadership of their most important saint Abädir 'Umar ar-Ridä and his followers. In the *Fath*, Karbinäl is anachronistically designated as a "Portuguese." In the year 619 H. (1222 A.D.) he was able to defeat the Haräri at Afärdabba, east of Harär, and to enter their camp, but two months months later the Muslims under 'Umardïn won a battle at the same place and again defeated the Christians at Babilé, a village 30 km. east of Harär on the road to Jijiga, in 625 H. (1228 A.D.).  After some further conflicts Karbinäl was killed by the Haräri ruler Nasrawï in 651 H. (1253 A.D.). He was succeeded by his son Jurniyäl.
