Ousas, Emperor (perhaps fl. c. 5th century A.D.), was a Christian ruler of the Aksumite Empire of the fifth or sixth century, known only from his coins. These were struck in gold, bear his effigy and the Cross of Christ, and are inscribed in Greek, bearing the legend "By the Grace of God." Kammerer is of the opinion that they were minted in South Arabia during the Aksumite occupation of the region.

Richard K. P. Pankhurst
