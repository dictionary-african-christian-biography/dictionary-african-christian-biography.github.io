S&auml;wen (probably fl. late 12th -13th century A.D.), was an ecclesiastical dignitary during the reign of Emperor Lalibäla of the Zagwé dynasty. He held the office of *liqä diyaqonat*, or Archdeacon, one of the heads of the secular clergy. A reference to him in a charter granted by the Emperor to the monastery of Däbrä Libanos of Šimäzana shows that he was probably in office during the time of *Abunä* Mika'él of Fua, Metropolitan of Ethiopia c. 1205-1209 A.D., while another dated charter shows that he was still holding the same office in 1225 A.D.
