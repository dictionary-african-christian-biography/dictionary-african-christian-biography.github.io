Aedesius (Ge'ez: 'Adesyos) (fl. early 4th century A.D.), also known as Sidrakos, was the brother of Frumentius, who introduced Christianity to Aksum around 330. Less gifted than his brother, Aedesius officiated for a time as cup-bearer, or treasurer, to Emperor 'Ellä-'Améda, and then assisted Frumentius in affairs of state, perhaps during the minority of Emperor 'Ézana. Latterly he returned to his native town, Tyre, to become a priest.
