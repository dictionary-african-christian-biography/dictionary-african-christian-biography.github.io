'Abreha, Emperor, ruled the Aksumite Empire with his brother, Emperor 'Asbeha, according to the *Synaxarium*, when Frumentius returned from Alexandria as Bishop of Ethiopia. Ethiopian tradition generally places the introduction of Christianity into the country in the reign of 'Abreha and 'Asbeha, while documentary evidence contemporary with the event makes it clear that it occurred under Emperor 'Ézana and, perhaps, his brother Prince Se'azana. Ethiopian monarchs have, however, traditionally borne more than one name. One hypothesis consistent with Ethiopian custom is that 'Ézana and Se'azana were baptized with the symbolic names 'Abreha (He illuminated) and 'Asbeha (He brought the dawn) when they embraced Christianity.
