Dan'&eacute;l, *Abun&auml;*, was Metropolitan of Ethiopia apointed during the Patriarchate of Philotheos (979-1003), after a period of half a century without a canonical ordination. An unnamed ruler of Ethiopia wrote to George, the Christian king of Nubia, telling him of a queen of the *'Bani al-Hamüya'*  who was scourging his country as a punishment for the treatment meted out to *Abun&auml;* Pétros; this is probably a reference to the infamous Gudit or Yodit. George was asked to intercede with the Patriarch and request a properly consecrated *abun* for Ethiopia. Dan'él of the monastery of Abü Maqar was chosen, and the queen was apparently defeated.
