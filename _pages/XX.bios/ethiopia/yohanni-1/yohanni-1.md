Yohanni, *Abba*, was Abbot of Däbrä Damo, the celebrated monastery in Tegré, probably in the first half of the 13th century. From the *Gädlä 'Iyäsus-Mo'a* we learn that *Abba* Yohanni was in his youth a great dignitary of the realm, second only to the Emperor himself, who had bestowed upon him his own daughter in marriage and appointed him to high office. A time came, however, when Yohanni vowed to renounce all his worldly honours and possessions in order to embrace the monastic life. In spite of the Emperor's remonstrances, he retired to Däbrä Damo and there lived in perpetual prayer and fasting until the end of his days. There also he is said to have received and instructed both *Abba* 'Iyäsus-Mo'a and *Abba* Täklä-Haymanot, instilling in the former the qualities of humility and rigorous asceticism for which he became renowned.
