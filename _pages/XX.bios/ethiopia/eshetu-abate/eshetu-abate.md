*&ldquo;The  Christian faith begins by grace, exists by grace, and comes to fulfillment by  grace&rdquo;* (Eshetu Abate, in *African Bible  Commentary*).

Born  in the Arbe Gona district of Sidama Zone in the Southern part of  Ethiopia, Eshetu Abate became one of the most influential African theological  thinkers, a pastor, and a leader of considerable reputation. Through his  lectures and writings, he has contributed to the development of theology in the  African context. Through his leadership and life testimony, he was able to  influence his students, who later became leaders in different churches and  organizations throughout the world.

Eshetu  was born in 1955 to his mother, Ijigayehu Kasaye, and his father, Abate Koyra.  He completed his primary and secondary school education at Sodo town of Wollaita in  1974. Though he was offered the opportunity to study medicine in the Soviet  Union, he insisted on studying theology and following God&rsquo;s call. He earned his  Bachelor of Theology degree from Mekane Yesus Theological Seminary (MYTS) in  Addis Ababa in 1981, and his PhD from Concordia Seminary in Saint Louis, MO, in  1988. Eshetu married Amarech Abate and they had three children: Miseker,  Eliezer, and Benjamin.

He  served as a teacher and vice principal at the Tabour Theological Seminary in  Hawassa (1981-1983). When Tabour Seminary was confiscated by the former Marxist  government of Ethiopia, he was called to Mekane Yesus Theological Seminary  where he served as a teacher and academic dean of the Department of Theology  (1988-1992) and as principal (1996-2000). He was one of the visionaries that  started the Ethiopian Graduate School of Theology, where he lectured for two  years (1994-1996). In the meantime, he was called by the Addis Ababa Mekane  Yesus Congregation to ordained ministry and served the congregation on a voluntary  basis. He has also served at the Bible Society of Ethiopia, an organization  that works to translate Scriptures to various Ethiopian languages, and as  consultant for Bible translation.

Upon  receiving an invitation to serve as a lecturer at Concordia Seminary in Irvine,  California, as member of Christ College&rsquo;s faculty, he came to the United States  in 2002, where he remained until his death on December 28, 2011. Dr. Steven  Mueller, Dean of Christ College, describes Eshetu as &ldquo;a faithful scholar [who]  was devoted to his students.&rdquo; According to Mueller, Eshetu &ldquo;was kind and soft  spoken, but had a powerful witness whose faith was so pure, strong, and  sincere.&rdquo; [1]

Besides  teaching, he was engaged in planting congregations for Ethiopian Lutherans  living in America. These congregations were planted in Los Angeles and in Long  Beach. He was a founder and chairperson of the Evangelical Mekane Yesus Church  Lutheran Fellowship in North America (EMYCLFNA), which was founded by the  members of the EECMY in North America. He also led the team and contributed to  the peace and reconciliation process between the Ethiopian Evangelical Church  Mekane Yesus (EECMY) and the congregations that separated from the Church for  over twelve years (the so-called Addis Ababa and the Surrounding Church).

Eshetu  grew up at the time of monumental change. He finished his secondary education during  the feudal government (44 years of reign). A few years after socialist  governments came to power (1974-1991), he joined MYTS and studied theology. He  served under the socialist and the federal government (1991 to present) until  his death in 2011. The emphasis of his writings, poor and marginalized communities,  indicates the impact of the socio-political and socio-economic situations  during his life on his theology.  He was  Christ-centered in his theological approach, and had the conviction that a  Christian or the church should evaluate and face realities from the perspective  of the cross of Jesus Christ.

Eshetu&rsquo;s  contribution to theological development in Africa has been given due  consideration in the past few years. His contributions include a commentary on  the books of Philippians and Titus in *Africa* *Bible* *commentary *where he stated that &ldquo;[t]he Christian faith begins by  grace, exists by grace, and comes to fulfillment by grace&rdquo;); &ldquo;A Study Note&rdquo; in *The Lutheran Study Bible*, published by Lutheran Church  Missouri Synod (LCMS); Amharic books on the *Trinity  and Sacraments*; and many others. His unpublished dissertation is entitled &ldquo;The  Apostolic Tradition: A Study of the Texts and Origins, and Its Eucharistic Teachings  with a Special Exploration of the Ethiopic Version.&rdquo; [2] His writings,  particularly those written in Amharic, are still being used for teaching  Lutheran doctrine to lay ministers.

In  2015, a collection of Abate&rsquo;s works, *Christian  Theology in African Context: Essential Writings of Eshetu Abate*, was  published. [3] The collection contained Abate&rsquo;s essays published in different  books and journals. The significance of the essays for churches in Ethiopia and  beyond are two-fold. First, they were written during the last period of the Socialist  government of Ethiopia and the first decade of the Federal Democratic Republic  of Ethiopia (between 1990 and 2002). This time signifies the years in which  Ethiopia was going through social, economic, political, and religious changes.  Eshetu, as a prominent theologian and pastor, reflects on issues that the  Ethiopian communities faced during those periods. Second, Eshetu is one among  few Ethiopian theologians who have initiated the conversation about Christian  theology from an African perspective. He understood his own context, which  included the crucial, existential issues that African Christians were facing, to  be the legitimate context out of which Christian theology should emerge. He did  so without compromising the centeredness and uniqueness of Christ. [4]

4. I  knew Eshetu personally while he was teaching at Mekane Yesus Seminary (MYS). He  and my father, Yonas Deressa, were close friends and coworkers. Both of them  had lectured in the same institution for years and were also part-time pastors  at the Addis Ababa Mekane Yesus congregation. I was attending elementary and  high school while the two labored together. Eshetu left Ethiopia and joined  Concordia Seminary, St. Louis, MO, in 2002, a year before I became a student at  MYS for my first degree in theology. It was at MYS that I was first introduced  to some of his essays by one of my professors, Rev. Dr. Johnny Bakke. A few  years later, while lecturing at MYS (2008-2011), I included these essays as  part of the required readings for one course on African Christian Theology.  I also had the opportunity to have fruitful  conversations with Eshetu about his essays and some other theological issues  when he visited me and my siblings during his trip to Ethiopia for a vacation  in 2008. I found Eshetu to be a man of deep theological knowledge. He was  humble and generous in his personality, and creative and visionary in his  leadership.
