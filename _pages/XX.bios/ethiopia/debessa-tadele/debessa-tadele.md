Tadele Debessa is from the Fakiso clan of the Sidama  people group in the Sidamo Province of southern Ethiopia.  His parents were traditional religionists and  worshipped the high God *Magano.* The spirit cult was administered by the *kalicha,* who were greatly feared by the  local Sidama population for it was believed that they controlled life and  death, sickness and health.

It was through an itinerant evangelist that Tadele&rsquo;s  uncle first heard about Jesus. This  uncle then shared the Gospel about Jesus to other relatives including Tadele&rsquo;s  family. Tadele began to understand that  Jesus Christ is stronger than all the spirits of the Sidama traditional  religion. At age 21 he was baptized by  the Danish Lutheran missionary, Rev. Milant.   Soon after Tadele&rsquo;s conversion and baptism, his mother became a believer  and she eventually served as an outstanding evangelist in the Bale and Sidama  regions.

In his youth, Tadele had limited formal education,  but through various means he managed to read and write in Amharic, the national  language of Ethiopia. After studying in  a short rainy season course at the Dodola Danish Mission, in 1967 he was given  the opportunity to attend the Dilla Mekane Yesus Bible School for one  year. Tadela was then assigned as an  evangelist to his home area of Hamesho, in Sidamo. He served in this capacity from 1968 to 1980. As he was well respected in the area he was  elected as chairperson of the local farmer&rsquo;s association. In this position he was able to mobilise the  local residents to build schools and roads and to conduct adult literacy  classes. Because of political unrest in  the Hamesho area caused by the Sidama Liberation Movement, with the support of  weapons from Somalia, Tadele moved his family to Dodolo in 1980 where he began  teaching in the Mekane Yesus Bible School.

1982 began a dark period in the life of Tadele. He was arrested by militiamen and marched to  the local police station in Dodola. He  was accused of propagating the &ldquo;*metey  hayimanot&rdquo;* (a new religion from beyond) and assisting the anti-government  Sidama Liberation Front. After several  days he was transferred to a secure prison in Adaba where prisoners were  severely tortured or killed. Tadele  later commented, &ldquo;Throughout my life, I have never been troubled as on that  day. Indeed it was the darkest moment of  my life.&rdquo; He had cause for concern as  the chief administrator of Bale Region was none other than Ali Musa, who took  delight in prisoner torture and mass killing.   Tadele was interrogated at all hours of the night, &ldquo;Tell us, why do you  propagate this &lsquo;new religion&rsquo; and how have you helped the rebels, who are  anti-Revolution?&rdquo; Tadele would respond  with the same answer: that he taught about Jesus and that he knew nothing about  the rebels. He was then taken to the torture chamber, tied and gagged and the  soles of his feet beaten with a rubber mallet until they were shredded.  His body was also severely beaten with a sapling. This questioning and torture continued for  several days in an attempt to get Tadele to confess  About one cruel beating that went on all  night Tadele later related, &ldquo;I felt I was in a burning fire. It was the night I experienced hell on  earth. The tortures were horrible.  I was beaten so severely and every beating  produced more pain. The torturers had no  pity in their hearts. In the morning I  was unable to walk to the toilet so the guards hauled me there.&rdquo;

Several months later he was transferred back to the  Dodola police station. He was in a better  situation as he was no longer tortured and was near his wife and children. But a new trial faced him. He agonized over the question of why God  would allow this to happen to him, an innocent person. His wife and children  were suffering from sickness and lack of food.  And each day fellow-prisoners from the Dodola police station were taken  out and shot by command of killer Ali Musa.

After three months in the Dodola police station, he  was transferred to the large prison located on the outskirts of Dodola, called  the Genale Prison. Here he was  incarcerated for over three years. Even  though the prison was crowded, Tadele was allowed the freedom to share his faith  with Muslims and many non-believers. He  became the prison literacy teacher. Through  the help of the national Mekane Yesus Church his family received  assistance. Two of his sons were sent to  the Mekane Yesus Hostel in Yirga Alem where they attended high school.

In 1986 Tadele was finally released from prison and  returned to his previous position of teaching in the Dodola Bible School and  serving in the local Mekane Yesus Church, which he did for a number of  years.  In 1994 he and his wife were transferred  to teach in the Bansa District Bible School that served over 200 local  churches.  Here he had the opportunity to  advance the cause of Sunday Schools.  His  axiom was, &ldquo;If we teach the children well, we can greatly influence tomorrow&rsquo;s  world.&rdquo;  He was influential in training  many Sunday School teachers. He also  organized conferences for the younger generation and promoted drama and choirs.
In  2003, Tadele and his wife took up residence in retirement in Hawassa, the  capital of the Southern Nations Region, after a resilient comeback from prison incarceration.
