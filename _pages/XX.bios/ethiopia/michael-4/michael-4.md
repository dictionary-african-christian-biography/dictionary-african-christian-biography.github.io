Michael IV, Al-Habis was a Coptic Patriarch of Alexandria said to have been dispatched on a mission to Ethiopia to dissuade the Ethiopians from interrupting the flow of the Nile to Egypt. It appears that the Egyptians attributed exceptionally low flood waters, resulting in famine, to Ethiopian intervention at the source of the Nile subsequent to the dispute with Egypt arising from the activities of *Abunä* Säwiros. Holding office from c. 1092 to c. 1100 A.D., Michael IV was sent to Ethiopia, according to the thirteenth century Coptic historian al-Makin, by the Fatimid Caliph al-Mustansir (1035-1094 A.D.), and took with him many gifts to placate the Emperor.
