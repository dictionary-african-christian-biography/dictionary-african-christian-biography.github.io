'Éndreyas, (probably fl. late 12th -early 13th century A.D.), was an important ecclesiastical dignitary of Bugena in the reign of Emperor Lalibäla of the Zagwé dynasty. In a land grant made by the Emperor to the monastery of Däbrä Libanos of Simäzana, he is mentioned as holder of the title of *qalä-pappas*, i.e spokesman or interpreter for the *pappas* or metropolitan, in the time of the Bishop, or *pappas*, Mika'él, who may probably be indentified with *Abunä* Mika'él of Fua, Metropolitan of Ethiopia c. 1205-1209 A.D.
