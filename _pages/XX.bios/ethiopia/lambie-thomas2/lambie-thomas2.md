Thomas Lambie was an American medical missionary
in Ethiopia. Born in Pittsburgh and raised in a godly Presbyterian
home, he received his medical degree from the University of
Pittsburgh in 1907 and the same year sailed for Sudan as a
United Presbyterian missionary. Soon after meeting missionary
Charlotte Clave in Alexandria, Egypt, he married her, and
together they opened a new station in 1911 at Nasir among
the Nuer, on the southeastern border of Sudan. They crossed
the border into Ethiopia in 1919 to help fight a flu epidemic,
and later, after he had successfully treated a provincial
governor, Lambie was commended to the future emperor, [Haile
Selassie](../haile-selassie/), who asked him to open a hospital in Addis Ababa.
Lambie also became Selassie's personal physician. In 1927,
impatient with the inaction of his U.S. mission headquarters,
Lambie launched the Abyssinian Frontiers Mission, which quickly
established several new stations in the south and southwest.
The same year he merged the new work with the Sudan Interior
Mission (SIM). Additional stations were established some 200
miles to the north of Addis Ababa. In 1934 he gave up U.S.
citizenship in order to hold property in Ethiopia, but later
lost his Ethiopian citizenship after falling out of favor
with the emperor, who disagreed with Lambie's decision to
treat casualties on both sides in the war with Italy. During
the Italian occupation (1935-1941), Lambie served as executive
director of the Ethiopian Red Cross. Although heart problems
prompted his return to the United States in 1942, in 1945
he was able to sail for Palestine under the Independent Board
for Presbyterian Foreign Missions. His wife died enroute and
was buried at Port Said, Egypt. His second wife, Irma Schneck,
an SIM missionary from Ethiopia, helped hi open Berachah Tuberculosis
Sanatorium in Bethlehem in 1952. He died in Jerusalem in 1954
as he prepared a message to be given on Easter morning at
the Garden Tomb. He is buried in Pittsburgh.[1]

Editor's note:

1. According to Rev. Keith H. Coleman, Lambie was not buried in Pittsburgh but in Bethlehem on the Baraka Bible Presbyterian Church property. Rev. Coleman is the Executive director of the IBPFM (1000 Germantown Pike B6 / Plymouth Meeting, PA 19462 USA / Phone: 610.279.0952). Email messages to M. Sigg
dated 5/2/2012 and 7/31/2012. In a message dated 7/31/2012, Rev. Coleman wrote: "I have visited the grave site of Dr. Lambie myself and have a photograph of it. Also, here is the email of Pastor George Awad (info@barakachurch.com), who ministers at the Baraka Bible Presbyterian Church in Bethlehem. He can confirm that Dr. Lambie is buried at the end of their property. Last of all, our own missions publication, *Biblical Missions*, states in the July-August 1954 issue, in an article entitled 'Dr. Lambie Called Home' (p.6),  'After a brief service in our chapel at Bethlehem, Dr. Lambie was laid to rest in the churchyard on the hillside facing west, under the shade of two olive trees.'"
