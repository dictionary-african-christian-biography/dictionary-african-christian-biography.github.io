G&auml;br&auml;-'Endreyas, *Abba* (perhaps fl.13th century A.D.), was a monk of Däbrä Qozät. According to the *Gädlä 'Iyäsus-Mo'a*, he became a disciple of the saint and, with *Abba* Hezeqeyas, preached from Wägda to Gojjam. Unless this reference is anachronistic it seems that he should not be identified with the *Abba* Gäbrä-'Endreyas who was at the death-bed of *Abba* Gäbrä-Mänfäs-Qeddus (v. Vol. II).
