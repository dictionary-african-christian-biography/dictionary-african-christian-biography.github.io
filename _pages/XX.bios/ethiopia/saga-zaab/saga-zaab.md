S&auml;ga-Z&auml;-'Ab (perhaps fl. late 12th -early 13th century A.D.), was the father of St. Täklä-Haymanot. Of a priestly family, he was living in the district of Zoräré in Selaleš, now Bulga, in Šäwa, when he had to flee from the persecution of the pagan governor of Damot, Motälamé. His wife, 'Eszi'e-Haräya, was only saved by divine intervention and was reunited with him in Zoräré, where their son was born.
