Z&eacute;na-Marqos, *Abba* (perhaps fl. 13th - early 14th century A.D.), of Morat was a cousin of St. Täklä-Haymanot, being the son of his uncle, Zär'a-Yohannes, and himself became a saint of the Ethiopian Church. He was a disciple of the saint, who invested him with the monastic habit. He is associated with the monastery of Däbrä Zéna-Marqos.  Many marvels are recounted concerning the life of *Abba* Zéna-Marqos, he is said to have preached in Gojjam and the kingdom of Adal and to have been the apostle of Guragé in a text contained in a Vatican Codex. His feast is commemorated on 3 *Tahsas*.
