Ya'eqob I, *Abunä* (perhaps fl. c. 9th century A.D.), appears in several lists of the Metropolitans of Ethiopia. A bishop of this name appears as the thirtieth ecclesiastic to hold office in the list published by Wright, and as the forty-eighth in the list published by Zotenbeg. A Metropolitan of this name is also mentioned by the Coptic historian, Girgis ibn al-'Amid (al-Makin), and Chaîne has suggested a tentative dating of c. 848 A.D., but has pointed out the possibility of confusion with a predecessor, Yohannes I.
