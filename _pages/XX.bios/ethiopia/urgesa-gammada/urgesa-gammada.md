Gammada Urgesa was born in 1912 in Gimbi  district, Wellega, in Western Ethiopia.   When Gammada was a young boy his father, a community official, died.  His mother placed him under the tutelage of  an Orthodox priest and Gammada was taught to read, write and to converse in the  Amharic language. Under the Haile Sellassie government, because  of his facility in Amharic in Oromoland, Gammada was appointed to various  government positions such as the Challia Ekka school director (1947-1952),  Bojji Chokorsa sub-District governor (1953-1962), Nejo  District Court judge (1963-1966), Nejo District governor (1967-1969), and vice-governor  of Gimbi Province (1970-1973).

Gammada was a champion of education at a  time when peasant farmers were reluctant to send their children to school.  He was also innovative in launching local  industries such as smelting iron ore for the production of agricultural tools, setting  up looms for the weaving of blankets and cloth for clothes, and developing a  saw mill to produce lumber for furniture production. For his role in providing employment for hundreds  of local artisans, Emperor Haile Sellassie honored him with the title *Balanbaras*.

Prior to the Italians&rsquo; occupation of  Wellega in 1936, Gammada heard the gospel from itinerant evangelist, Ashana,  trained by the German Lutheran missionaries.  Together with Evangelist Ashana, he began evangelizing in the Tegi and Challia  districts. Even when they faced  persecution from the Italians, Gammada and Ashana carried on valiantly. After the defeat of the Italians, Mekane  Yesus Church leaders from Aira, such as *Keis *Daffa, nurtured Gammada in the faith through bible study and by providing  him with Christian books. Soon churches  were established in Tegi and Challia through the encouragement and financial  support of Gammada. It was through the  impetus of these two centers that a number of Mekane Yesus congregations were  established in those two districts.

Gammada developed a close working relationship  with missionaries from the German Hermannsburg Mission as well as the Swedish  Evangelical Mission during his years serving as an evangelist and then  eventually as a government official.  He  served on various Mekene Yesus Church committees with the missionaries,  offering his cultural wisdom and spiritual insights.  In turn he appreciated the technical help the  missionaries offered various communities in road building and setting up grain  grinding mills.  Through a combined  effort with the German missionaries a vocational trade school and an  agricultural demonstration plot were established at Challia. Gammada was a forerunner of the Ethiopian  Highway Authority in Wellega in organizing communities to build a road from  Aira to Challia by manual labour.

The Marxist Revolution forced Gammada out  of his local area of Challia in 1974. He  retired to Addis Ababa and worshipped at the Mekane Yesus Church in Finfinne  until his death in 2000. *Balanbaras *Gammada left three  significant legacies behind: He served  his country well and with integrity for over 30 years as a government official;  through his encouragement and cooperation, many in the district of Challia and  Tegi were evangelized; and modern methods of development were introduced by  him, together with mission agencies, which created substantial improvement within  Wellega communities.
