S&auml;lama Z&auml;-'Az&eacute;b, *Abunä* (perhaps fl. 9th or 10th century A.D.), was Metropolitan of Ethiopia in the reign of Emperor Del-Nä'ad according to the *Gädlä 'Iyäsus-Mo'a*. He encouraged the Emperor to build the Church of St. Stephen on Lake Hayq, which was later to be associated with the monastery of *Abba* 'Iyäsus-Mo'a. He is said to have come to Ethiopia 618 years after his namesake Sälama I, St. Frumentius.
