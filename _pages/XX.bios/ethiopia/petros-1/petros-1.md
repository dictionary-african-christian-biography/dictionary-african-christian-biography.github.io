P&eacute;tros, *Abunä* (? perhaps fl. c. 5th century A.D.), was, according to traditional sources, an early Bishop of Ethiopia of whom little seems to be remembered except his name. In the list of Metropolitans published by Wright he appears as the successor of *Abunä* Minas, instead of *Abunä* Abreham, whose name occurs in other sources.

Richard K. P. Pankhurst
