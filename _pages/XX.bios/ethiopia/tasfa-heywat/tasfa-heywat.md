T&auml;sfa-Heyw&auml;t was an important ecclesiastic dignitary during the reign of Emperor Lalibäla of the Zagwé dynasty. According to a land grant made by the Emperor to the monastery of Däbrä Libanos of Šimäzana, apparently during the episcopate of *Abunä* Mika'él of Fua, Metropolitan c. 1205-1209 A.D., Täsfä-Heywät held the high office of abbot of the monastery, with the title of *'aqabé sä'atä,* at that time. By 1225, another land grant shows that the office was then held by Yerde'anä-Krestos.
