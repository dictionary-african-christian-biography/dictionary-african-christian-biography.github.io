Saint  Walatta Petros (Ge'ez:&nbsp;ወለተ፡ጴጥሮስ,  Wälättä P̣eṭros, 1592–November 24, 1642) is one of thirty women saints in the  Ethiopian Orthodox Täwaḥədo Church and one of only six of these women saints  with hagiographies. She was a religious and monastic leader who led a revolt  against Roman Catholicism, defending the Ethiopian Orthodox Täwaḥədo Church  when the Jesuits persuaded King Susənyos (1572-1632) to proclaim Roman  Catholicism the faith of the land. Her name means &ldquo;Daughter of [St.] Peter.&rdquo; Her  followers wrote down the story of her life about thirty years after she died, in  1672, with a monk in her monastery named Gälawdewos serving as the community&rsquo;s  amanuensis (this hagiography has been translated into English).

She was  born in 1592 into a noble family, her mother was named Krəstos ˁƎbaya (In  Christ lies her greatness) and her father was named Baḥər Säggäd (The [regions  by the] sea submit[s] [to him]). Her father adored her, treating her with great  reverence and predicting that bishops and kings would bow down to her, giving  her the name of the man upon whom God built his church, Peter.

She was  married at a young age to Susənyos&rsquo;s chief advisor, Mälkəˀä Krəstos (Image of  Christ). After all three of her children died in infancy, she grew tired of the  things of this world and determined to leave her husband to become a nun. Not  long after, in 1612, Susənyos privately converted from the Ethiopian Orthodox  Täwaḥədo Church to Roman Catholicism, and over the next ten years, he urged  those in his court, including her, to convert as well, finally delivering an  edict banning orthodoxy in 1622. When Walatta Petros first left her husband,  around 1615, he razed a town to retrieve her and she returned to him so that  more people would not be harmed. Then she discovered that her husband had been  involved in the murder of the head of the Ethiopian Orthodox Täwaḥədo Church  and she again determined to leave her husband, starving herself until he let  her go. She immediately went to a monastery on Lake Ṭana and became a nun at  the age of 25, in 1617. There she met, for the first time, Ǝḫətä Krəstos, the  woman who became her constant companion in life and work and the abbess of her  community after Walatta Petros&rsquo;s death.

Walatta  Petros lived quietly as a devout and hard-working nun and might have remained  as such if the king had not banned orthodoxy. Her hagiographer reported that  she did not want to keep company with any of the converts, so she took several nuns  and servants and fled her monastery, going 100 miles east of Lake Ṭana to the  district of Ṣəyat. There she began to preach against Roman Catholicism, adding  that any king who had converted was an apostate and accursed. The king soon  heard of these treasonous remarks and he demanded that she be brought before  the court. Her husband and powerful family came to her defense, and so she was  not killed, but was sent to live with her brother in around 1625, on the  condition that she stop her teaching.

However,  she soon fled him (taking the same nuns and servants) and moved from Lake Ṭana to  the region of Waldəbba, about 150 miles north, which was then drawing many  monks and nuns who refused to convert and were fomenting against the new  religion. While there, Walatta Petros had a vision of Christ commissioning her  to found seven religious communities, a charge she only reluctantly took up.  She left and went to the region of Ṣallamt, east of Waldəbba, and again began  preaching against conversion. The angry king again called her before the court,  and this time she was sentenced to spending Saturdays with the Jesuits, as the  head of the mission, Afonso Mendes, worked to convert her.

When  this was unsuccessful, the king banished her, alone, to the Ethio-Sudan  borderlands, Žabay, a hot and barren place. There she endured many hardships,  but many monks and nuns who did not want to convert found her and became  members of her community. Due to the kindness of the queen, Ǝḫətä Krəstos was  allowed to join her. Thus, Žäbäy was the first of the seven communities  prophesized. After three years the king relented and she went with her  followers to live in the region of Dambəya, on the northern side of Lake Ṭana,  setting up her second community, Č̣anqʷa. More men and women followed her  there, and when sickness broke out, she moved her followers to Məṣəlle, on the  southeastern shore, her third community.

Finally,  in 1632, fifteen years after Walatta Petros had become a nun, a disheartened  Susənyos rescinded the conversion edict and died just a few months later. Walatta  Petros was revered as a heroine for her resistance to early European incursions  in Africa. For the next ten years, Walatta Petros&rsquo;s community continued to grow  and the next king, Fasilädäs, looked on her with great favor. She set up her communities  at Dämboza, Afär Färäs, Zäge, and Zäbol. Then, after a three-month illness, she  died, twenty-six years after she had become a nun, and was buried at the  monastery or Rema on Lake Ṭana.

In 1650,  Fasilädäs gave land to establish her monastery at Qʷaraṣa, on Lake Ṭana, which  remains her monastery today. Walatta Petros&rsquo;s fame continued to grow over the  next century, and her monastery became an important sanctuary for those fleeing  the wrath of the king, for whom she performed many miracles, as recorded in her  hagiography.

Unfortunately,  the edition of her life published in 1912 was based on one manuscript, and that  very corrupted, so most of the research about her published before the recent  English translation and edition, based on twelve manuscripts of the  hagiography, contains incorrect information about her life. Typical errors in  previous works were stating that her hagiography was written in Afär Färäs;  that all three of her children were sons; that she was born in 1594; that she  died in 1644; and that she went to Aksum.
