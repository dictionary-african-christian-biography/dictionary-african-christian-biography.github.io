'Afs&eacute;, *Abba,* ( perhaps fl. late 5th and early 6th century A. D.), was one of the Nine Saints of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church who came to the country as Monophysite missionaries. He is said to have originated in Esya, or Asia, probably Edessa, and his name is patently Syriac. There is a *gädl* (Acts) of the saint which has not been published, but of which a summary is available. It states that he went  from Esya to Rome, where he met *Abba* Yeshaq (*Abba* Gärima), who had just abdicated. From there he went to Ethiopia in the time of Emperor 'Al'Améda (Emperor 'Ellä-'Améda II) and remained with Yeshaq for a while before proceeding to the River Geba and thence to the land of Bäläsat. From there they went to Mujja and Däbrä Gännät, suffering persecution from the local peoples all the way. Twelve years later he moved on to Gärima's convent in Mädära, whence an angel took him to Yeha. There he was welcomed by the people and subsequently visited by Emperor Kaléb. He built a little church and formed a community round him, receiving tithes and the village of Baray from Kaléb. On his death at an advanced age, he made a certain Qozmos his successor. Together with * Abba* Guba, 'Afsé is commemorated on 29 *Genbot* (5 June).
