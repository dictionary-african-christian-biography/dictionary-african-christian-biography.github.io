Glen  Cain was raised on a farm with his three sisters and three brothers on the  Avoca River, Victoria, Australia. He attended the Natte&rsquo; Yallock State School  to 8th grade, then boarded at the Caulfield Grammar School through  to grade 11, after which time he was employed by the State Electricity  Commission for four or five years. While attending the Melbourne Bible  Institute from 1925 to 1927 he heard Dr. Rowland Bingham and became interested  in serving in Ethiopia.[[1] ](#). Immediately  after graduating from the Bible College, he departed by ship to Ethiopia to  serve with the SIM. He was one of the 11 initial SIM party that arrived in  Ethiopia on Christmas Day, 1927[[2] ](#). Glen Cain was assigned to  Garbitcho, Sidamo Province along with Dr. and Mrs. Lambie. But before the SIM  could get established at Garbitcho, the missionaries were issued an eviction  notice by the local governor, *Dejazmatch *Biru.  Eventually Dr. Lambie was able to have an official letter written from Addis  Ababa to appease the local governor. The new mission site allocated to Glen  Cain and his cohort Eric Horn was located at a much lower elevation at Homacho[[3] ](#). On Christmas Day, 1932 in  Homacho, Glen Cain and Dr. Lambie baptised the first four Sidamo believers[[4] ](#). In 1933 Glen Cain began  the translation of the Gospel of Mark into the Sidaminya language with the help  of the four baptized believers. Before the SIM missionaries left Ethiopia in  1937 printed copies by the Bible Society of Mark&rsquo;s Gospel were distributed  among the Sidamo believers[[5]](#).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

In 1933 Glen Cain married Winnifred  Robertson of New Zealand. They served together at Homacho until their eviction  in 1937. Daughter Naomi was born in Soddo in 1936 and son John in Khartoum in  1938. After Winnie&rsquo;s death in 1961, Glen Cain married American Lucile Wickstrom  in 1962[[6] ](#).

Because if the Italian invasion of  the North, communications were blocked from the four SIM missionaries stationed  in the Lalibella/Debra Markos areas, Dr. Lambie assigned Glen Cain and his wife  Winnie to trek by mule to the North where they successfully established  contact.

Because of the Italian/Ethiopian  conflict he transferred to the Anglo Egyptian Sudan in 1937 to initiate with other  SIM expatriates the ministry of SIM.

In 1941 he joined the British  Army and was attached to the Sudan Defence Forces. He served with the rank of  captain in their Intelligence Department and was with the troops that  successfully cleared the way to bring Emperor Haile Sellassie back to Addis  Ababa. In 1947 he returned from Australia to Ethiopia where he became Area  Director of SIM Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia &ndash; a position he retained until  1957. After spending a several years in church work in Alatta Wondo with SIM,  he then joined the Baptist Bible Fellowship in 1962 and assisted this  organization in pioneering ministries in Northern Ethiopia. After his wife,  Winnie, passed away he rejoined SIM in 1967. With his new wife, Lucille, and  nurse daughter, Naomi, they opened a new station at Alaba and served there  until 1974. After a 10 year battle with Parkinson&rsquo;s disease at the SIM  Retirement Centre in Sebring, FL he passed away in 1984.
