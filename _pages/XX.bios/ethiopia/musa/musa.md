Mus&auml;, *Anba*, also known as Moses the Black, was an Ethiopian monk who lived in the Egyptian desert. Said by Palladius to have been a slave, he was obliged because of insubordination to leave his native country, and became a robber, and even, according to Cassianus, a murderer. After swimming across the Nile with a sword between his teeth to kill a shepherd against whom he bore a grudge, he is said to have seen a vision, and hearing of the ascetics of the Western Desert, he decided to join them. He met St. Isidore and St. Macarius and lived a highly ascetic life in spite of constant temptations. Later he was ordained as a priest and subsequently, learning of a possible raid on their settlement at al-Baranus by the Mazices, he warned his disciples, then seventy in number, advising those who wished to make their escape. For his part he remained behind with seven other monks in the hope of gaining martyrdom, and is believed to have died at the age of seventy-five. *Anba* Musä is remembered in both the Ethiopian and Coptic *Synaxaria*, in the former on 24 *Säné*, and has been described by the modern German scholar Otto Meinardus as "the first martyr of the desert fathers."
