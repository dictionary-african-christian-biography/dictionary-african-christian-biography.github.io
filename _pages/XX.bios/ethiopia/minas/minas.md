Minas, *Abunä* (perhaps fl. c. 4th century A.D.), is known in Ethiopian tradition as the second Bishop of Ethiopia, and appears in several lists as the immediate successor of *Abba* Sälama. A later *abun* of the same name is listed in one source as the fiftieth ecclesiastic of that rank.

Richard K. P. Pankhurst
