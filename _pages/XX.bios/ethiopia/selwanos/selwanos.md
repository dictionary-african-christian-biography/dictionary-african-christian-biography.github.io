Selwanos, *Abba* (perhaps fl. 13th century A.D.), was a disciple of *Abba* 'Iyäsus-Mo'a, and is said to have understood the language of the birds and beasts. While on a journey during the closing years of the Zagwé dynasty, he stayed in the house of a wealthy man where the child and future Emperor, Yekuno-'Amlak, was living. There *Abba* Selwanos heard a cock crowing and interpreted its cry to mean "whosoever eats my head will become king." Yekuno-'Amlak ate the head which had been thrown aside by a careless maid-servant and the prophecy was of course fulfilled. In later traditions, the last Zagwé king, Yetbaräk or Zä-'Elmäknun, is said to have heard and understood the crowing of the cock and to have sought the advice of St. Täklä-Haymanot.
