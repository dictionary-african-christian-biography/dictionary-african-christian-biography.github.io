Yohannes or Johannes, Bishop, was almoner of the Church of St. John in Alexandria. According to the story of Emperor Aidog, when the Emperor of Ethiopia defeated the ruler of Himyar, he requested a bishop for his country, and the lot fell to Yohannes, then, in c. 525 A.D., a man of sixty-two years. It seems likely, however, that he was in fact sent to Himyar.
