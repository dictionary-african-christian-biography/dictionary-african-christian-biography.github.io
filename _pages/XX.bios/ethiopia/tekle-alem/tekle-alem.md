Alem was born in the district of Akule Guzai in Eritrea and  was raised in the family of Orthodox Church followers.  He did his initial schooling in Asmara and as  a teenager joined the Infantry Division of the Army in Asmara.  Because of his physical prowess and  intelligence, in 1960 he was selected to join the Air Born unit and was  transferred to Debre Zeit, located near Addis Ababa.   While in Debre Zeit he pursued his education  through to high school by attending evening school.  Because his supervisor noted that Alem was a  keen student, it was recommended that Alem should enrol in the three-year  technical training programme in Holleta, Shoa province.  Upon graduation he served for ten years at  the military base in Harar, in eastern Ethiopia.  In 1980 he had an opportunity to do a six  month field electronics course in the Soviet Union.  When he returned to Ethiopia, he was assigned  to the Debre Zeit Air-Ground Defence Unit.   Soon he discovered that his Soviet electronics training was inadequate for  his designated work.  Eventually he was  assigned as an instructor in the woodworking division – a position he held  until 1991 when he was discharged from the Airborne Division.  Subsequent to that he was employed by the  non-government agency, SOS.  Then, from  1999 until his death in 2004 he served in his local Debre Zeit Full Gospel  Church.

Alem Tekle&rsquo;s lasting legacy in the Debre Zeit Full Gospel  Church was his servant/leadership role in ministry.  He was an ardent evangelist among his peers  at the Debre Zeit Airforce Base.  He was  also an able discipler and bible teacher in the house church movement during  the communist era.  He was a man of  wisdom who shared godly counsel to the many members of the church, although his  greatest contribution to the members of the Debre Zeit Full Gospel Church was  his prayer life.  By his prayers various members  of the Debre Zeit congregation were healed; others were delivered from their  anxieties by his prayers.  Because of  Alem&rsquo;s steadfast prayer life, the spiritual and physical needs of hundreds of  adherents of the Debre Zeit Full Gospel Church were met.
