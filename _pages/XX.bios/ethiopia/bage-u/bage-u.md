B&auml;ge'u, or B&auml;g'&auml;-Krestos, *Abba*, was originally a notorious brigand who was later converted and reformed his ways, joining *Abba* 'Iyäsus-Mo'a, the celebrated abbot of Däbrä Hayq as one of his disciples. He is recognized as a saint by the Ethiopian Church and unpublished manuscripts of his hagiography have been found at Daga on Lake Tana and at Hayq. From the latter text it is clear that *Abba* Bäge'u lived and died in the lifetime of his teacher, *Abba* 'Iyäsus-Mo'a. He was thus apparently never abbot of Däbrä Hayq himself, as Conti Rossini once assumed, but is revered for his proverbial monastic reputation.
