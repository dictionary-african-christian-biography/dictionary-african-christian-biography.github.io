'Atnat&eacute;wos, *Abuna *(?) (perhaps fl. c. 12th century A.D.), is mentioned in an unpublished *Gädlä Yemrehannä-Krestos* from Bétä Mädhané-'Aläm, Lalibäla, as a Metropolitan of Ethiopia appointed during the reign of Emperor Yemrehannä-Krestos of the Zagwé dynasty. The name is so far unconfirmed from other sources.
