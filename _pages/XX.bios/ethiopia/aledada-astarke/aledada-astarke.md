An able young woman and good example to the church, Astarke remained unmarried in order that she might give herself full time in service to the Lord.

Astarke was born in 1957 in Zella Shegne Kebeley of Gamo Gofa Province.  Her father was Aledada Abush.  She studied through Grade eight and also went to middle-level Bible School.

For nine years, Astarke coordinated the Theological Education by Extension program in her area.  She also was a leader in the women's programs during those years.  At various times she suffered persecution because of her faith.  She was imprisoned for four years during the Dergue Marxist regime.

She was killed by bandits in 1987 at Uba Kifle Mehibir, Gelletta, while walking back to  her home after a teaching seminar.  She had a Bible in her hand when she died.
