**Introduction**

Michael  Timneng (1898-1968) worked against great odds to lay the foundations of Roman  Catholicism among the Kom people in Cameroon. He was born as a member of the  Kom people, and reluctantly served as a retainer to the traditional Kom ruler  (or *foyn*), Ngam. After fighting for  the Germans in the First World War, Allied forces interned him from 1916-1919.  While in prison, Timneng came in contact with German Pallottine fathers, who  had been working in Cameroon since 1890. The Pallottines followed a model of  mission that relied heavily on indigenous catechists. They taught Timneng  Catholic doctrine and equipped him as a catechist in the hope that he would  carry his new religion home. When he finally did return home, Timneng  audaciously challenged the authority and polygamy of Foyn Ngam. With little  assistance from foreign missionaries, Timneng stood bravely by his convictions  and nurtured the young Catholic Church among the Kom. It is perhaps ironic that  Ngam had earlier welcomed the Sacred Heart Fathers to establish a mission  station among the Kom in 1913. But the direct challenge to Ngam did not come  from foreign missionaries, but rather one of his own subjects. Timneng&rsquo;s story  sheds light on the relationship between foreign missionaries and indigenous  initiatives in African Christianity. It also provides an example of the  tensions that can develop between traditional religion and Christianity in  Africa. Ultimately, however, Timneng&rsquo;s story helps us understand why Catholicism  in Cameroon is such a vital force today.

**His Birth**

Michael  Timneng was born in 1898 at Wombong in what used to be Western Grassfields of  Cameroon. At age ten, the Kom Royal Palace conscripted him to serve in the  royal court at Laikom as a retainer (*chindo*).  Retainers were members of the ruling elite known as *Kwifoin*—the legislative arm of the traditional Kom administration—and  they managed the royal household and acted as administrators and diplomats.

Timneng found the job to be a difficult fit. He  was accused of hurling a stone and wounding another retainer, after which he  fled to his birthplace in fear of reprisal*.* This incident occurred at the outbreak of the First World War. Since Cameroon  was under German protection, the German government asked Foyn Ngam to conscript  young men for colonial military service in Cameroon. Foyn Ngam recommended  Timneng for conscription. Timneng was an insubordinate retainer, and sending  him off to join the German army was one way of getting rid of a thorn in flesh  of courtly life.

As  he was being taken from his mother&rsquo;s hut, Timneng thought he was going to be  returned to the palace to complete his service. When he was informed that the *foyn* was sending him to the army, he said,  &ldquo;It is better to serve the white man than to be a slave under Foyn Ngam.&rdquo; Foyn  Ngam is described in Kom history as a brutal leader who even had his own  brothers and cross cousins killed by the Germans. It is also noted that his wives  exercised undue influence on him. Together with six other stubborn retainers,  Timneng became a soldier. With the defeat of the Germans in Cameroon by the  Allied forces in 1916, Timneng and the six were interned at Fernando Po in  Equatorial Guinea.

While  in prison, they met the German Pallottine Fathers, who taught them Catholic  doctrine. For three years, Father Baumeistter, who was one of the missionaries  that started the mission station at Fujua in 1913, drilled the young men in the  catechism, eventually baptizing them. At baptism, Timneng took the name Michael.  He was also equipped to be a catechist. He was designated as the converts&rsquo;  leader, and given the catechism of the Roman Catholic Church in German. While  Father Baumeistter trained the young men in the Catholic faith, it was up to  them to return to their own people with the new religion.

In  July 1919, Timneng and his fellow converts arrived back in Kom dressed in German  military uniforms. As custom demanded, they visited the palace and met Foyn  Ngam. There, the *foyn* asked the  returned soldiers to present the spoils of war. Timneng replied, &ldquo;It was good  you sent me to be killed by the white man. Instead of killing me, he has given  me this small book to bring back and preach the Christian doctrine and restart  the church you authorize them to build.*&rdquo;* The *foyn* showed no interest in his  reply as he insisted on the presentation of war booty. If they had nothing to  offer, they would be stripped of their uniforms and kept in the palace. To the  astonishment of both the *foyn* and his  advisers, Timneng replied bluntly, &ldquo;This can never happen.&rdquo; Their military  uniforms emboldened them and protected them from being arrested by the local  palace retainers. His hands tied, the *foyn* simply allowed them to return to their village, hoping they would live normal  lives. But the *foyn* was mistaken.  Once back in their village and without delay, Michael Timneng started a prayer  group in his uncle&rsquo;s compound at Wombong. This group soon attracted the interest  of many, some of whom would become Catholics. As the membership of the prayer  group grew, they moved from the compound of Timneng&rsquo;s uncle into a church  building. Interest expanded and two communities were formed at Wombong and  Njinikom respectively.

**First arrest: Bi Wa&rsquo;ah, the runaway  royal wife**

The  Christian faith had already emboldened Timneng in his stand against the *foyn*&rsquo;s authority. Perhaps the *foyn* would have continued to tolerate  this marginal insolence, but soon Timneng&rsquo;s faith posed a challenge to the *foyn*&rsquo;s own household. As Timneng  preached against polygamy and witchcraft, many royal wives began to flee the  palace and take refuge in this new community of Christians. The first royal  wife to join the Christian prayer group was a young woman named Bi Wa&rsquo;ah. She first  encountered Timneng&rsquo;s community while on a visit to her mother. She found freedom  amidst the gathered believers and she refused to return to the palace. Timneng  was soon accused of &ldquo;taking the *foyn*&rsquo;s  wife.&rdquo; He was asked to return Bi Wa&rsquo;ah to the palace. He refused because she  had joined of her own volition. His response to the *foyn*&rsquo;s request was further interpreted as contempt. Timneng made it  abundantly clear that he could not send her away. Palace retainers were sent to  arrest Timneng for failing to obey royal orders and he was locked up in the  palace. Bi Wa&rsquo;ah was also forcefully taken back to the palace. They were both  subjected to severe beatings. Timneng was released after several weeks and Bi  Wa-ah rejoined the royal household. As tempers calmed, Bi Wa&rsquo;ah escaped again  to rejoin the Christian community, and this time she was followed by other  royal wives. By 1923, twenty-five royal wives had fled the palace, taking  refuge in the new Christian villages at Wombong and Njinikom. This situation was  shocking and completely unacceptable to the traditional authorities. The  emerging Christian group consistently disobeyed the royal orders of a ruthless* foyn*. Wanting to regain his traditional  position of authority and his wives, the *foyn* hatched a plan to re-arrest Timneng.

**Second arrest: The horror of torture**

Two  palace retainers were sent to start a fight on the church premises in order to  justify Timneng&rsquo;s re-arrest. They arrived and forcefully seized corn from a  young boy who had come to sell it and attend catechetical instructions at  Timneng&rsquo;s Church. When the boy yelled and requested payment for the corn, they  told him to go and ask Timneng to come and pay. When Timneng overheard the row  outside the church, he rushed out and found the retainers and ordered them to  pay. As he insisted, the retainers yelled back at him saying: &ldquo;Go tell your God  to come pay!&rdquo; Furious at their insolence, Timneng gave them a good beating.  Unable to contain Timnneg, they ran back to the palace. A few days later, the *foyn* sent a contingent of forty  retainers to arrest Timneng for attacking palace retainers.

After  his arrest, Timneng was detained for two months. In his absence, his followers  continued to gather and pray for his release. During his detention Timneng was  beaten, tortured and forced to carry feces every day. He continued to preach his  faith, saying that if his listeners did not convert to Christianity, they would  go to hell—a message he brazenly delivered to the *foyn*. Foyn Ngam was so furious that he ordered Timneng to be  beaten. Timneng challenged Ngam&rsquo;s authority to such an extent that the *foyn* asked if he wanted to take the  throne. Timneng retorted &ldquo;I am not a member of the royal lineage and therefore  have no ambition to be a ruler. I am a commoner preaching God&rsquo;s gospel and  nothing more.&rdquo; [1]

After  undergoing this inhumane treatment, Timneng was taken to the magistrate court  in Bamenda on two charges; viz., taking the *foyn*&rsquo;s  wives and beating palace retainers. On the first count, he was accused of  encouraging the *foyn*&rsquo;s wives to  become Christians. In response to this accusation, Timneng said *everyone was free to attend his church*,  and he could not force anybody to attend his church services. On the second  count, he denied having beaten palace retainers, and no one provided evidence  to the contrary. Since the court did not have enough evidence for either charge,  Timneng was acquitted. Jubilant crowds welcomed him back to Njinikom, and even  more people became Christians. Timneng also embarked on the monumental task of  translating the German catechism and prayers into itangiKom, the mother tongue  of the Kom people.

**Third arrest: The closure of the church**

Angered  by the outcome of the trial in Bamenda, the *foyn* decided to close down the church. He dispatched a contingent of retainers under  the leadership of a senior palace retainer, Ngong Fundoh to close the church.  When they arrived, Timneng was away in Shisong to meet the resident parish  priest whose jurisdiction included the whole of Kom. The royal party met only seventeen  Christians. With his band of retainers, Ngong Fundoh arrested the seventeen  Christians, sealed the church, and ferried prisoners to the palace where they  were detained.

When  Timneng returned from Shisong and found his church sealed, he went to the  palace. Arriving there, guards stopped him to ascertain his identity. He told  him that he was the person the palace retainers came looking for in Njinikom.  He had come to have his people released from the palace prison. The guards  immediately arrested him and put him with the seventeen others. They were  jailed for several weeks and the church remained closed.

This  continuous molestation of Christians was reported to the British administrators  of the colony. The growing tension and animosity between Christians and  traditional authority could not be ignored. Mgr. Plissoneau of the Apostolic  Prefecture of the Adamawa travelled to Njinikom in 1921 to visit the persecuted  Christian community and he said a mass attended by over 300 Christians. After  Timneng&rsquo;s third arrest, British administrators D. O. Duncan of Bamenda and S. D.  O. Roxton of Buea travelled to Njinikom to assess the situation for themselves.  On their arrival they found the church sealed. Duncan and Roxton sent soldiers  with a message asking the *foyn* to  report to Njinikom. Terrified, the *foyn* arrived Njinikom and refused to go near the church. He instead sent his trusted  servant, Ngong Fundoh who had sealed the church in the first place, to go and  unseal it. Furious that he had been humiliated by the British administrator,  the *foyn* returned to Laikom vowing  never to set foot in Njinikom. He declared that he had abandoned that part of  his kingdom to Timneng and the white man.

When  Foyn Ngam died in 1926, Njinikom and its Christians gained more breathing room.  The new ruler, Foyn Ndi, adopted a conciliatory approach, reconciling his  Christian subjects with the rest of his people.

The  Christian faith continued to flourish as the Christians received protection  from the British administration and the new ruler. It is interesting to note  that between 1919 and 1926, Timneng kept the faith alive by resisting all kinds  of persecutions. It was not until March 1927 that a resident priest, Father  Leonard Jacobs, was appointed to take over the good work of Michael Timneng who  was appointed as the catechist. In 1931, Michael Timneng was made head catechist.

By  1931, Michael Timneng, without any formal education, finished translating the  German Catechism into itangiKom. Apparently the little German he had learned  while he was interned in Fernando Po was sufficient enough to perform this  monumental translation work*. *

When  Michael Timneng died in 1968 in his native village Wombong, the small Christian  community he had established in 1919 had become a full parish with resident  priests. Today, the territory that used to be controlled by that parish has  become an archdiocese with over forty-one parishes.

The  seed that was sown by the Pallottines and the Sacred Heart Fathers was nurtured  and kept alive by Timneng and his companions. The area that once had only seventeen  Christians in 1923 now has over two hundred thousand Christians. His legacy  lies in his audacity and courage, his translation of the German Catholic catechism,  the training of other catechists and the compositions of religious hymns that  captured the spirit of joy in his Christian community. He championed monogamy  and became a model himself when he married Martha Chituh. The couple had twelve  children, all brought up in the Catholic faith. When the Archdiocese of Bamenda  celebrated 100 years of Christianity (1913-2013), they remembered the early  years (1913-1927) as a difficult time, but one presided over by the strong and  audacious person of Michael Timneng. It was men and women like Timneng, as much  as any foreign missionary, who were responsible for the growth of Christianity  across the African continent.
