Someone  has said, &ldquo;The measure of man&rsquo;s life is not in its duration but in its  donation.&rdquo;  This quotation aptly  describes the life of Frank Kwesi Adams. Kwesi Adams was born on October 9, 1949  in Kumasi to Rev. Frank Adams, an ordained  minister of the Methodist   Church, and Mrs. Hannah  Adams. He lost his father at the tender age of two.

**Youth and education**

He  attended Nana Nketsia Primary School Esikado in Sekondi, and under the tutelage  of his stepfather, the young Frank was able to sail through the storm of early  life. He attended Technology Secondary School, and Opoku  Ware School,  both in Kumasi,  where he obtained his GCE Certificate in 1968.

In  his adolescent years, Frank was not only interested in books, and he had shown  other interests earlier. For example, as a boy he had been blessed with a great  voice and he loved singing. At the age of eight he passed an audition and  gained admission to the prestigious Cathedral Choir of St. Andrew Anglican  Church, Sekondi, as its youngest member. A young chorister in a procession of  adults soon attracted attention, and most notably that of the church registrar,  a lawyer and philanthropist named James Mercer. Mr. Mercer offered Frank a  scholarship to continue his education at St. John&rsquo;s  Grammar School, a boarding school in Accra. Later, before  venturing into full time ministry, Frank engaged in evangelization with the  Singspiration Group, which worked through music performance in schools and  churches.

**Marriage and calling**

Frank  Adams was a family man. He was married on December 20, 1975 to Selina at Grace Baptist   Church, and the marriage  was blessed with three children.

He  worked as a village teacher for several years, and then worked at Kumasi  Brewery Ltd. as a clerk. Adam&rsquo;s call to the ministry came in the early 1970s,  while he was working at the brewery.   Although Ghana  was in a serious economic mess, his genuine love for God compelled him to leave  this good job for pastoral ministry, which happened to be among the  lowest-paying jobs at that time.

**Theological education,  ministry, and achievements**

Ably  encouraged and supported by his wife, Adams gained admission to Abuakwa  Theological Seminary (now the School  of Theology and Ministry, under Ghana Baptist   University College)  and graduated with the Diploma in Theology. After his training at Abuakwa  Seminary, he worked as an associate pastor with Rev. Dr. Boadi at Grace Baptist  Church, Kumasi, and later as the senior pastor and  minister in charge in the same church.

As  a man with a passion for academic study, he traveled to Switzerland in  1985. While there, he obtained a Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1989 and a  Master of Theology in 1991 at the Baptist International Theological Seminary, Ruschlikon, Switzerland,  and returned to Ghana  in that same year. In 2003, he earned a PhD from the Oxford Centre for Mission  Studies in the United    Kingdom.

On  his return from Switzerland,  he took up the challenge of serving as the first General Secretary of the  unified Ghana Baptist Convention. The Convention had come back together after a  separation in the late 1980s, and needed a skillful leader to unite it. He was  able to steer the affairs of the Convention ably, as is evidenced by its&rsquo; rapid  growth and development from 1992 to 2000. By the year 2000, the Convention had  about 1,000 churches, whereas it had numbered fewer than 200 in 1992. He laid a  solid foundation for the Convention&rsquo;s administration and implemented the  computerization of the Convention&rsquo;s accounts, which ensured that financial  statements were up to date for every single Convention church. He made frequent  visits to all the churches and associations, especially in the North, which  enabled him to become well-informed of problems in the field.

Another  notable achievement was that he established a &ldquo;Needy Pastors Support Fund,&rdquo;  which brought much relief to less-privileged ministers. His ability to listen  and also to explain issues assisted in bridging the local church/Convention  communication gap. This led to improvements in commitment and response levels  to Convention projects during his tenure. When he left office, significant  funds of reserves in Treasury Bills had been accumulated for use by the  Convention.

His  international visits brought the following two projects to the Ghana Baptist  Convention: the Ghana/UK Support Group, which continues to help the Mafi and  Frankadua Project; and the Convention/Spurgeon College collaboration with the  Seminary (now the School of Theology and Ministry, under Ghana Baptist   University College).  Also, through his initiatives, many ministers of the Convention received  support for further training overseas.

Frank  Kwesi Adams&rsquo; sphere of influence also extended beyond Ghana, since he also served as the  General Secretary of All African Baptist Fellowship (1997-2006). Through his  wisdom and administrative skill, he worked hard to ensure that there was unity  and peace among the Unions/Conventions in Africa.

**Death and tributes**

He  died in 2006 while working on a project that aimed to build on the capacity of  theological institutions to encourage leadership development for Africa.

In  a tribute to him, his wife described him as a very humble person, while others  described him as a man of integrity, a very caring person who always put others  first. He also had a sense of humor, and was very jovial!

Rev.  Dr. Steve Asante, the incumbent president of Ghana Baptist Convention,  described him as a team player who was always ready to play second fiddle if  needed--he never fought to be in the front. He was a man of prayer who did much  to create space for the poor and the needy. At the ecumenical level, he worked  for the principle that all denominations belong to the family of God.

Rev.  Baffour Adu-Gyamfi, his Assistant General Secretary while he was in office,  described him as a very honest person. Although Frank Adams did not live long,  he lived a fulfilled life by making his personal contribution to the growth of  Christianity in Ghana and in Africa  at large.
