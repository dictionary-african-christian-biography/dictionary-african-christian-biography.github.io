Elias Schrenk was a German missionary in Ghana and evangelist in Germany and Switzerland. Schrenk worked for the Basel Mission (BM) in Ghana from 1859 to 1873. His formal role was that of administrator-treasurer, but his character and intelligence made him a force to be reckoned with in the whole range of BM work in Ghana. In 1865-1866, during a furlough in Europe, he distinguished himself by effective lobbying in the House of Commons against British plans to give up the Gold Coast Colony. After his permanent return to Europe he was an evangelist, serving from 1879 with the Evangelical Society of Canton Bern (in Switzerland), and then based in Marburg, Barmen, and Bethel. He was widely respected as an inspiring speaker and an experienced pastor with great personal authority. Records in the BM archives show that, in this latter phase of his life he maintained pastoral contact with a large number of people and practiced faith healing by the laying on of hands.
