André Duguy was born on March 3, 1906 in
Saint-Étienne-de-Montluc, a large village of about 4,000 inhabitants
in the département of Loire-Atlantique. His father, Philbert
Duguy, was a clockmaker in his village, his mother was named
Marguerite Blot, and he had an older sister. Until he went
away for his military service, he hardly left his home village,
which is where he learned clockmaking from his father.

After his military service, he attended Saint-Ilan school
in his home diocese. Two years later, in September of 1929,
he entered the novitiate of the Holy Spirit Fathers in Neufgranche,
Alsace, as he wanted to become a missionary. He entered the
order on September 28 of the following year, and went on to
pursue his studies in philosophy and theology in the scholasticates
of Mortain, in Normandy, and Chevilly-la-Rue, near Paris,
where he was ordained as a priest on October 5, 1935.

In July of 1936 he was sent to Guinea, where he devoted eight
years of his life to the missions in Mongo, Malouma, and the
supply center in Conakry. Apparently, for reasons related
to his health, he then spent ten months in the large vineyards
owned by the Holy Spirit fathers in Misserguin, near Oran.
In 1945, his superiors gave him charge of the postulancy of
Langonnet, in the diocese of Vannes. He moved on from a brief
stay there to Marseille, where he worked for two years in
the supply center there.

In the spring of 1948, when he was forty-two, he was sent
to Senegal, first as a vicar in Dakar. Five years later he
was carrying out his ministry on the river, near Saint-Louis.
After a long sabbatical in the mission in Auteuil, he returned
to the capital city of Senegal, where he served as a vicar
again, and also as the archivist of the diocese. In 1963 he
was appointed to be the priest of Gorée, and he stayed on
as archivist of the archbishopric. From 1968 to 1975, he served
as chaplain in the city's hospitals.

For reasons related to his health, he retired somewhat from
the work right in Dakar, and stayed with the principal superior
of the Holy Spirit Fathers. However, on March 11, 1978, he
had to return to France.

He lived in the Spiritan house in Langonnet for three years,
after which time he asked if he could move to Piré, in the
diocese of Rennes. On August 9, 1984, he suffered a hemiplegia
that led to his death eighteen days later.

He left behind significant historical material relating to
Senegal and to Gorée, in particular. Although he was very
generous in sharing his great learning with all who came to
him, he was very modest, and did not want his work to be published.
His manuscripts, however, bear witness to his patient work
as a historian.
