Father Ezanno was born on April 17, 1873, in Port-Louis, in the French *département* of Morbihan. He studied theology in Langonnet (Morbihan), then in Chevilly. He was ordained to the priesthood in Orly on August 15, 1897, and took his missionary vows in Langonnet on August 15, 1905. He was sent to Dinguira, in the French Sudan, (presently Mali), and was put in charge of the school there. He stayed there from November of 1897 to January of 1898, at which time he was sent to Kayes. In Kayes, he was in charge of the school and also served as chaplain to the hospital. He left Kayes in September of 1899 and carried out his ministry successively in Goué, in Popemguine, in Ngazobil (where he was director of the seminary), in Karabane (Casamance), in Thiès, in Rufisque, and finally in Fadiout. On December 4, 1903, he became the director of the mission he had founded there.

It was to the unusual village of Fadiout that Father Ezanno gave himself fully, and it  was there that he was able to best express his gifts as a spiritual and practical leader, in all modesty. He devoted himself completely to the town of Fadiout and stayed there for thirty-five years.

The island of Fadiout, which is located at the mouth of the Sine River, is presently connected to the mainland by a footbridge. At low tide, only a narrow but deep and muddy channel separates it from land. On a tiny sandbar, about 4,000 Serers, most of whom are Catholic, live in close proximity in huts and houses. Most of them were pagans when Father Ezanno arrived, and he contributed significantly to their conversions. Father Ezanno also devoted himself to agriculture, fishing, and harvesting shellfish. His flock was very fond of him, and for good reason: he was not only their guide in moral matters, but he was also the one they came to for help and counseling when they had problems. He became the island's only doctor, and he also taught the people how to improve their living conditions, as they were often quite difficult owing either to drought or to the excessive rains that flooded their fields. In addition to everything else, he also held the position of administrative liaison, a position that came with a certain degree of local authority. One of the greatest difficulties that households on the small island faced was the lack of water. This was their lot until 1958, when a water conveyance was installed. Before then, women had to go get water at the well in Joal, and bring it back to the village by dugout.

In 1938 Father Ezanno contracted a heart ailment and had to leave Senegal for the Abbey of Langonnet. Unfortunately, his health deteriorated rapidly, and he died on December 15, 1938, of pulmonary congestion. He had endured his condition with patience, courage, and simplicity, "willingly sacrificing his life for Fadiout and for Senegal, the land that was so dear to him, and that he would have loved to see again."

He worked in the village for so long that he was completely one with the life of his parishioners. He spoke the Serer language so well that he ended up knowing it better than the natives themselves, and he served as something of a collective memory bank for them in that regard. He became a great authority on the Serer language, and published several works on linguistics (see the bibliography). Unfortunately, several of his manuscripts were never edited, and a lexicon as well as an essay on Serer grammar that he wrote, have never been published.

Father Ezanno also had an interest in botany. In 1930 he met the famous botanist and explorer Auguste Chevalier (1873-1956) during one of the latter's trips to Senegal. The professor of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris asked him if he would correspond with him on scientific matters, probably after having become acquainted with a manuscript written by Ezanno called *Brousse et jardins Sénégalais* [Bush and Garden in Senegal]. Although the book was ready to go to press in 1930, it was not published for lack of funds. Sadly, it was never printed, and even worse, it seems to have vanished.

Extraordinary people like Father Ezanno certainly need to be recognized, as they worked with humility, perseverance, courage, and faith. Although they are largely unknown, and were often isolated, they nonetheless contributed to the influence of France that is exerted abroad.
