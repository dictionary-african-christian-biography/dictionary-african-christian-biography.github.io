Co-founder of the IMC (Consolata Missionaries).

Giacomo Camisassa was born at Caramagna, in the diocese of Turin, on September 26, 1854. He was trained for the priesthood in the minor and major diocesan seminaries of Turin and was ordained a priest in 1878. Allamano appointed him vice-rector of the Consolata Shrine for forty-two years. Camisassa was his most devoted and active cooperator in the foundation and development of the IMC. In 1911 he paid a long visit to the Consolata missions in Kenya. Of Camisassa Allamano said, "I never had anyone more cooperative and obedient than him." He died at Turin on August 18, 1922.
