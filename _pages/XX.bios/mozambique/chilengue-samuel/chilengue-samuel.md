Pastor Samuel  K. Chilengue (c1890-?) gave the following testimony in 1971:

> I thank my Saviour Jesus who redeemed me from my sins.  I was a drunkard and possessed demon things.  God sent preachers who found me in 1906.  They sang, "Here is Jesus! Let us go to Him".  They read Matthew 3:10, "The ax is already at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire," and they spoke in Zulu.  When they closed their eyes to pray, I opened an eye to see who it was that carried the axe so that I could chase him away.  God spoke to me and I followed them and learned God's word.  I learned to read and was able to read Matthew 3:10 for myself.  I gave myself to the Lord Jesus and He forgave me.  I brought my demon things and they were burned.

In 1908 Chilengwe went to Chicumbane to enroll in the Portuguese school.  Rev. Baker came and held a baptismal service at the Chilembeni Church.  Several of the older pastors of the area kept one wife and sent away their other wives because of the gospel.  In 1910 a preacher of the Gaza Church, Esaya Fuwele, began a congregation in his home at Nguazane.  Chilengue became his helper.  When Pastor Fuwele became sick and died in 1917, Chilengue carried on the work.  This congregation went along with him in joining the International Mission at Chaimite in 1922.

Starting in 1922 Chilengwe studied for three years in the Bible College at Modderfontein with missionary Rev. David B. Jones.  Returning to Mozambique in 1928, he carried on as pastor in the Gaza Church and in 1952 the congregation joined the Nazarenes.

Chilengue became a helper to Rev. J. Mahlayeye, and when he passed way in 1961, Chilengue became a helper to Rev. Loti Mulate.  Pastor Samuel Chilengue became leader of the Chaimite Zone when Mulate was chosen to be assistant to the district superintendent.  Upon retirement Chilengue was succeeded by Pastor Mateus Sitoe and Pastor Simion M. Chilengwe became pastor of the Ngauzane Church.[1]
