One of the eleven youthful companions ("pupils") of Speratus in the "Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs" (the earliest dated document from the Latin Church) brought before Vigellius Saturninus, the proconsul of the Roman province of Africa, who is recorded, in bearing witness ("martus"), to have said:  "I am a Christian."  She was beheaded on 17 July 180 A.D., and is collectively commemorated among "the Scillitan martyrs" [cf. Musurillo 1972:89; PDS 303].  For what few other details can be indicated on the basis of the minimal sources, see the entry "Speratus."
