J.G.M. Maseko was prominent among the Presbyterian church leaders who took the helm after the handover from the European missionaries in the early 1960s, known for his intellectual quality and musical ability. He was born on March 3, 1930 in Chituku village, Traditional Authority Njolomole, in Ntcheu District in the central part of Malawi.  He was the first-born in a family of six children. His father Grivin Missionary Maseko came from Kaziputa village, Traditional Authority Njolomole in Ntcheu District, while his Mother was Tabita Chapotera of Chituku village Traditional Authority Njolomole in the same district of Ntcheu. [1] In 1951 he married Grace Kinglosi from nearby Mtherekena Village. The couple were blessed with eight children, four sons and four daughters, though they experienced sorrow as four of them died in infancy. [2]

Maseko completed his primary school education at the mission school of Livulezi. He was then recruited as an assistant teacher and soon faced a testing experience. One of the missionaries serving with Nkhoma Mission, Rev A.S. Labuschagne, visited Livulezi in his capacity as the manager of schools. The school inspector gave a negative report concerning Maseko and recommended that he should not continue as an assistant teacher. Without giving any chance for Maseko to explain his side of the story, Labuschagne accepted the report and suspended Maseko from teaching. In disbelief, Maseko remained standing in front of him hoping that he would be given a chance to explain himself but to no avail. Labuschagne later regretted that he had treated the young teacher so harshly. [5] Maseko, however, was determined to continue with his education and went back to school where he worked hard until he passed Standard 10. In 1948 he went to William Murray Teachers Training College at Nkhoma Synod headquarters. [4] When he finished his teacher training in 1949, he went back to Livulezi School now as a full teacher. He taught in different schools in Ntcheu and Mangochi Districts, such as Khola Primary, Cape Maclear Primary, Chigodi Primary, Malembo primary and Kampanje Primary.

It was in 1963, when he was at Kampanje Primary School, that he felt the call of God to serve in ordained ministry. The three Synods of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian had newly established a united theological college at Nkhoma and it was here that Maseko undertook his theological education from 1966 to 1969. [6] He proved to be a bright and outstanding student, passing his final examinations with distinction. After his theological training, he was appointed as a probationer minister to Matenje CCAP in Salima District, where he completed one year under the supervision of Rev Botha who was based at Mvera CCAP. It was here in December 1969 that he was ordained to the ministry.[7]

On the recommendation of Scottish missionary Rev Charles Watt, Principal, and Rev. Kauta Msiska of Livingstonia Synod, Lecturer, Maseko was invited to join the teaching staff of the united theological college, which he did in 1971. While lecturing at the College, he went for further studies in Ireland from 1972 to 1974, obtaining a Diploma in Theology at the University of Belfast. While in Ireland he also developed his musical interest and gained skills in singing classical music. After his studies he returned to the college at Nkhoma and continued his work as a Lecturer. As his gifts in leading congregational singing manifested themselves, Maseko was selected to go to England to take a special course in church Music. [8] On his return to Malawi he became active as a composer. Some of his hymns, such as number 10 in Nyimbo za Mulungu (Worship Hymns), became well known and well loved. [3]

He took on a new responsibility as Synod Education Secretary, to look after all issues concerning education. A significant achievement during his time in office was the establishment of Mlanda Girls Secondary School at Mlanda Mission in Ntcheu. While he was fulfilling this role, the General Secretary, Rev Chienda, went to the USA for further studies and Maseko was appointed to act for him in his absence, there being no Deputy General Secretary at this time. [9] From 1984 to 1987 he served as Head of Programs at the Christian Service Committee, based in Blantyre. [10] This was an ecumenical body which enabled the churches to work together in social service and relief work. [11]

On returning to his own Synod, he served as a parish minister at Chitundu in Dedza District from 1987 to 1991, Livulezi from 1991 to 1997, Chitundu again from 1997 to 2001, and Kakoma in Mchinji District from 2001 to 2003. He was also elected to serve for a term as Moderator of the General Synod, the highest court of the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian. His final years of active service were spent back at the Theological College at Nkhoma, now renamed Josophat Mwale Theological Institute (JMTI), where from 2003 to 2006 he taught Congregational Studies, Church History and Music. [12]

On retirement in 2006, Rev Maseko and his wife Grace settled at Zimtambira Village in Ntcheu where he enjoyed rural life and was active as a farmer. Grace died in 2008 and three years later he married Nantheu who was from Chantulo village, Traditional Authority Namkumba, in Mangochi district. They lived together quietly until Rev Maseko died on July 2, 2020, at the age of 90. [13]

The Very Reverend Dr J.G.M. Maseko made a great contribution to the life of the church in Malawi. He was an outstanding figure among the first generation of Malawians to take up leadership responsibilities in the church after the missionary era came to a close. In parish ministry, educational leadership, theological teaching, musical composition and church leadership he made his mark, leaving lasting inspiration.
