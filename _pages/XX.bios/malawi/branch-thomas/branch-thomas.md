Missionary. He began his ministry in Pueblo, Colorado, in 1901.  The next year he was sent to the newly acquired Plainfield Mission station (renamed Malamulo Mission station in 1907), in Nyasaland (now Malawi), one of the first Seventh-day Adventist Black Americans to be sent overseas as a missionary.  His wife gave simple treatments and his daughter was in charge of the school.  He returned to the United States in 1908 because of ill health and engaged in pastoral work.
