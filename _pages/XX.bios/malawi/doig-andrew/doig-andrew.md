Andrew Beveridge Doig was a Scottish missionary and church statesman. After study at Glasgow University and at Union Theological Seminary (New York), Doig was sent by the Church of Scotland Mission (CSM) to Blantyre, Malawi (then Nyasaland), in 1938. From 1941 to 1945 he served as a chaplain with Nyasaland troops in East Africa and Burma. In 1954 he was appointed to the parliament of the new, and short-lived, Federation of Nyasaland and the Rhodesias to represent African interests until white intransigence forced his resignation in 1958. Meanwhile, he played a large role in the integration of the CSM into the indigenous church, the Church of Central Africa Presbyterian. Back in Scotland in 1962 he served a parish in Dalkeith, then became secretary of the National Bible Society. In 1981 he was moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.
