Malawian clergyman and educationist.

He was born in Masiye Village, Chiwanga Niassa province, Mozambique,
on the eastern shore of Lake Malawi directly opposite Nkota-kota
on the other side. His parents, from the same people as the
famous Undi chief whose land was later parceled between Nyassaland
(now Malawi) and northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), fled from
the Ngoni invasion of Malawi. These people, the original Nyanja
(so called in the local language because they were great fishermen
and were associated with the lake Nyaja) arrived on the Mozambique
side of Lake Malawi just after the partition of Africa. They
were the bearers of the original name of Malawi. They were
strong followers of the Anglican Church and out of their population
came a very high number of Anglican priests. The first African
translation of the Bible was into their language.

While Habil's father had given his children religious freedom,
he remained a polygamist and a famous trader (known as a *faida*)
in the coastland area of Tanzania, trading in elephant tusks,
hand crafts and possibly slaves in exchange for cloths, beads
and other commodities. He was not baptized until later in
life and even then insisted on being called Yusuf, the Muslim
or Swahili version of his baptismal name. Habil was enrolled
at the Chiwanga (Msumba) Lakeshore Mission School and attended
Sunday school as well in preparation for admission into the
Christian faith. When he was baptized he took the names Habil
Matthew Chipembere, dropping his traditional names.

Habil made rapid progress in school and easily passed the
Saint Michael Teachers' Training College Entrance Examination.
The school had been transferred from Kango, on the Mozambican
side of Lake Nyasa, to Likoma Island in what was then Nyasaland.
The transfer took place after Portuguese authorities had the
principal, the Reverend Arthur (after whom Habil named his
first son), murdered for refusing the local officers free
access to the women students. In 1915 Habil was admitted to
St. Michael's College, Makulawe, one of two students that
year. However, due to the fact that the college was closed
during part of the First World War, he did not finish his
studies until 1919, the year he married Drusilla Salim.

Since missionaries circulated freely between Tanganyika, Mozambique
and Nyasaland at that time, teachers and other members of
staff could be freely transferred from one territory to another.
Thus, after working for one year at his old school in Msumba
(Mozambique), Habil was transferred to various mission stations
in Nyasaland and in Tanganyika before he was eventually moved
to Fort Johnson (now Mangochi) where he and his family finally
settled among his people, who had also emigrated back to Nyasaland.
Habil also served as a tutor at his former Teacher's Training
College in Likoma before he enrolled as a deacon in 1933.
He qualified in 1935 and was ordained on 25 January 1938.
His first station was in Liuli in Tanganyika, then within
the diocese of southwest Tanganyika, which also includes Mozambique,
Malawi and northern Rhodesia. During World War II he was chaplain
to soldiers in Kenya and in that capacity travelled widely,
even as far as India. In 1960 Bishop Frank Throne ordained
him canon.

Such was the impact of his work as a priest that Habil was
promoted in 1963 to archdeacon--the first Anglican archdeacon
of southwest Nyasa. At this time, however, his family was
already heavily engulfed in the politics of Nyasaland. His
son Henry Masauko Blamus Chipembere was already on the forefront
of the struggle for independence and a member of the legislative
council as well as treasurer general of the Nyasaland African
Congress. When Masauko was jailed for three years, the Malawi
Congress Party, formed after the Nyasaland African Congress
was banned, unanimously nominated Habil for the Fort Johnson
constituency (the stronghold of Masauko). He was elected unopposed
and served as one of the respected old members of parliament
in self-governing Malawi until Masauko was released to take
up the seat himself in 1963.

Habil, however, went on to serve as a figure in Malawi politics,
particularly in the Mangochi (Fort Johnson) district. Thus,
after the Malawi 1964 cabinet crises in which three senior
members of government were sacked and three others, including
Masauko, resigned in sympathy, Habil fell out of favour with
the Banda regime after Banda had attempted several times to
win his loyalty, either by wooing him or intimidating him.
When finally Masauko, Silombela and others took up armed resistance
against Banda, Habil (already under various threats) felt
that he and his family were in danger. Eventually he was banished
from Likoma Island and chose to live in exile in Tanzania
where he served as a priest at his old station of Mbamba Bay
from 1966 on, the year he retired. He joined his son Masauko,
also in exile, in Dar-es-Salaam. Habil died in exile there
in 1976. At his funeral ceremony at St. Alban's Church, eight
fellow Anglican priests officiated, including Archbishop John
Sepeku of the Anglican Communion of Tanzania.[1]
