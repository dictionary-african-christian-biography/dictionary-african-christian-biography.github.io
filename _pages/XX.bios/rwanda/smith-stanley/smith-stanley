![A.C. Stanley Smith](images\bio-pics\rwanda\smith-stanely\smith-stanley.jpg){:class="bio"}
A C Stanley Smith was a Church Missionary Society (CMS) missionary doctor and Bible translator in Rwanda. Born in Tientsin (Tianjin), China, the son of Stanley Smith of the Cambridge Seven, Smith was educated at Winchester and at Cambridge. He studied medicine at St. George's Hospital, London. During World War I he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps in France and at the CMS Mengo Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. He and fellow officer Leonard Sharp felt called to the twin kingdoms of Rwanda and Burundi, soon to become Belgian trust territories. In 1921 Smith, his wife, Zoe (sister of Sharp), and Sharp began a CMS work at Kabale in the far south of Uganda. Within a few years they entered Rwanda and began medical and evangelistic work. This was the beginning of the CMS Ruanda Mission. Smith was field secretary for a number of years. He also took over from Harold Guillebaud as the mission's leading translator, completing the Bible in Kinyarwanda (1955), then the Ankole/Kigezi Bible (1964), as well as hymns, Anglican prayer book, and Pilgrim's Progress. Retiring from the mission in 1977, Smith died in England; his wife died in 1980. Their four children served in Africa: Nora's husband, Dick Lyth, was Anglican bishop of Kigezi, Uganda; Eve and her husband, Tony Wilmot, worked in both West and East Africa; Geoff Stanley Smith worked in Burundi as a medical doctor; and Jim Stanley Smith worked in Kenya as a teacher.
