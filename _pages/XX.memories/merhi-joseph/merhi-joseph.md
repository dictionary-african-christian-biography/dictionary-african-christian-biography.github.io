Joseph Merhi was born on January 18th, 1912 in Mreijat, Lebanon. At the age of twenty-four, he was ordained as a priest in the Congregation of Lebanese Maronite Missionaries and after serving for thirty-five years in Lebanon, he was appointed as a bishop of the Eparchy of Cairo, receiving his ordination in Egypt in 1972. He served as Bishop until 1989, when he retired at the age of 77. Bishop Merhi passed away in 2006 at the age of 94.
