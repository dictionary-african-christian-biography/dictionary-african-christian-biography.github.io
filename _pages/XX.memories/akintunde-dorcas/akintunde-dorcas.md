A BRIEF BIOGRAPHY AND TRIBUTE TO DR. DORCAS AKINTUNDE  
(Acting Head, Department of Religious Studies, University of Ibadan, Associate Professor in
New Testament and Women Studies)

She was born on 22nd February 1961. She was fondly called a "child of the mission yard"
because her father, the late Moses Ajibade Amusan was a pastor with the Christ Apostolic
Church.  

After primary school education she obtained the Grade II Teacher's Certificate in Education.
Afterwards, she had a Diploma in Religious Studies from the Department of Religious Studies,
University of Ibadan, in 1984 followed by a Bachelor's Degree in 1988, a Master's Degree in
1991, and a Ph.D in 2001. She was an Associate Professor in New Testament and Women
Studies and the Acting Head, Department of Religious Studies, University of Ibadan, Ibadan
Nigeria at the time of her shocking demise at the age of 50. She was the first female head of the
Department, even though in Acting Capacity.  

She won many notable academic awards and fellowships including: Mrs Jokotola Sobanjo
Memorial Prize for best female student in the Department of Religious Studies 1988; Bishop
Kate award for best student in the Department of Religious Studies, U.I. 1988; Post-Doctoral
Fellow Yale University, New Haven, USA, 2005-2006; and Post-Doctoral Fellow, Centre for
African Studies, University of Edinburgh, Scotland 2008.  

She belonged to, and played leadership roles in several learned bodies and organizations,
both locally and internationally including: Society for Biblical Literature, West African
Association of Theological Institutions; Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians;
Nigerian Association for Biblical Studies; Project for Christian-Muslim Relations in Africa,
International Association for the Study of Religion.  

She published over forty-five articles in learned journals, as well as several books and
monographs. She was well travelled and contributed to international projects on HIV and AIDS
in Africa, Europe and USA. She is fondly remembered for her courtesy, care and concern for
other's welfare and efficiency at work. She is a great mentor and role model to many. Most
students casually called her "Mummy Dorcas" while colleagues would occasionally refer to her
as "Aunty Dorcas" because of her usual concern for people's welfare. She was a family woman,
and indeed and egalitarian. The love she shared with her family is extended to all. Up to the
moment, we find it difficult to compose ourselves enough to comment meaningfully on her
virtues because she is still so dear and near to us and our emotional sentiments for her are too
deep. This was so glaring at her funeral.  She died on March 15, 2011.

Indeed, Africa has lost a gem of rare lustre...
