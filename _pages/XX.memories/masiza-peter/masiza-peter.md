Peter Masiza was the first African to be ordained in the Anglican Church (The Church of the Province of South Africa). He was made Deacon in 1873, and ordained to the Priesthood on St. John the Baptist’s Day in 1877, by Henry Callaway, Bishop of the Diocese of Kaffraria, now the Diocese of St. John’s.
