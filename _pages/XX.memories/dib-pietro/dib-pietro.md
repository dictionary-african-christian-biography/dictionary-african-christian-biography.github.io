Pietro Dib was born on June 13th, 1881 in Lebanon and ordained as a priest in 1907. In 1946, after moving to Egypt, he was consecrated as the Titular Bishop of Tarsus of the Maronites and stayed in the position only from April to July. He then was transferred to become the Bishop of Cairo of the Maronites and he remained in that position until his passing in November of 1964.
