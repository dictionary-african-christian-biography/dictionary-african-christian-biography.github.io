Divine Philip Yao Kumah was born in the Volta region. After receiving an extensive education in accounting, management, and publishing, he went into full-time ministry. He served as administrative manager in the Ghana Evangelical Society, then joined Calvary Baptist Church. In 1986, he launched *The Watchman* magazine that advocated for persecuted Christians in other countries. He  started Sonlife Press in 1994 to print quality Christian materials at an affordable price. He also cared for many orphans and widows.
