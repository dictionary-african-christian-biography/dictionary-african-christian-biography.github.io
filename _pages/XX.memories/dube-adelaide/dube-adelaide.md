Adelaide Tantsi Dube was an accomplished poet, married to Charles Dube, brother of John. She published both in Zulu and in English. She was an early teacher of note in the first few years of the 20th century. She and Charles taught at Ohlange School. One of her poems, entitled "Africa: My Native Land," spoke about the 1913 Land Act which restricted Africans to 7% of South Africa (later increased to 13%).
