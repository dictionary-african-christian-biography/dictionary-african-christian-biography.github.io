Siera Leonean clergyman and prominent educationist.

Born on 14 August 1845 in Freetown, he was the son of a Yoruba Creole clergyman, the Rev. Joseph May, who died in 1891. He worked first as a shop assistant until the age of 20, when it was decided that he should follow his father into the Wesleyan (Methodist) ministry. He did so after his education in England, and later at Wesley College, Taunton, Somerset and Westminster Normal Training School.

He returned to Sierra Leone in 1871. His ordination was delayed by the chairman and general superintendent of the Sierra Leone Methodist Church, the Rev. B. Tregaskis, who had sponsored his studies (and those of Samuel Lewis). The Church Missionary Society  was the other major Protestant mission in Sierra Leone and Tregaskis had long planned a secondary school to rival the CMS Grammar School. Nevertheless he delayed its opening until 1874 and Rev. J. C. May became its first principal. He was ordained in 1880.

For a quarter of a century the Rev. May headed the major educational institution in that early centre of Western education in West Africa. According to Prof. C. Fyfe in *A Short History of Sierra Leone*, "He was a fine teacher, kind and patient, who won the affection of his staff and pupils and made his School as good as, if not better than the CMS Grammar School." He remained principal until his death on 14 October 1902.

From 1882 to 1888 he was editor of the *Methodist Herald*. In September 1884, aided by Dr. E. W. Blyden, he founded the *Sierra Leone Weekly News*. It was the most famous of all the Sierra Leonean newspapers (which were of high quality) in the late 19th and 20th centuries. It was edited by J. C. May's brother, Cornelius, who later also became famous as a mayor of Freetown in the 1920s.

The Rev. May married Christiana Bull and they had seven children. He died in the year 1902.
