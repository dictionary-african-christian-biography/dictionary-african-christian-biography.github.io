First major Nigerian independent prophet.

Braide was baptized at Bakana in the Niger Delta Pastorate founded by Samuel A. Crowther. Later in 1915 he led a revival that featured mass baptisms, healing, Sunday observance, and active opposition to traditional religion and to imported articles, especially trade gin. Traditionalist complaints and fear of unrest as being seditious led twice to Braide's being imprisoned. Initial Anglican welcome changed to opposition, but loss of members from the Anglican Church to the movement led to Anglican indigenizing reforms. A variety of "Christ's Army" independent churches honoring Braide arose from the movement and continue in south-east Nigeria.
