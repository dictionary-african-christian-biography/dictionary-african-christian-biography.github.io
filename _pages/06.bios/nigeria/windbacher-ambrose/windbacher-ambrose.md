Peter John
Windbacher, the youngest of the three children of John F. and Mary E.
(Puljung) Windbacher, was born on March 23, 1914, in Chicago, Illinois. He
attended 0. A. Thorpe Grammar School and Lane Technical High School in
Chicago. He then worked in the Chicago area until he was called to duty during
World War II and served as a radio operator in the Air Force (1942-45) in
North Africa, Corsica and Italy. His war experience drew him closer to God and
when he returned to the United States he had already made a decision to become
a priest.

He entered the Dominican novitiate at St. Thomas Aquinas Priory, River
Forest, Illinois, on June 24, 1947, and was given the religious name of
Ambrose. He made his first profession of vows on June 25, 1948, and
immediately began his philosophical studies there at the Pontifical Faculty of
Philosophy in River Forest. Three years later he made his solemn profession on
June 25, 1951, and was transferred to St. Rose of Lima Priory, Dubuque, Iowa,
for his theological studies (1951-55). Bishop Loras Lane, auxiliary bishop of
Dubuque, ordained him a priest there on May 27, 1954.

Father Windbacher was assigned to the Province's Vicariate in Nigeria, his
first and only assignment. He began his duties as an associate pastor at St.
Dominic Parish, Yaba, Lagos, in 1955. During this time he served first as
assistant to the Novice Master for Cooperator Brothers (1964-65) and then as
Novice Master (1965-68). Soon he was appointed vocation director for the
Vicariate (1966-72) and was responsible for bringing many of the present
Nigerians into the Order. In September of 1972 he was appointed pastor and
superior of St. Dominic Parish where he served until May of 1975 when he was
elected Vicar Provincial. He served two terms as major superior, finishing
this ministry to the vicariate in 1983, and also served as the secretary for
26 Major Religious Orders of Men in Nigeria during this time.

Upon completion of his time as Vicar Provincial Father Windbacher returned
to his original ministry as associate pastor at St. Dominic Parish in Yaba,
always endeavoring to foster vocations for his beloved Nigeria. He was known
affectionately to the parishioners as "Papa Amby." When the vicariate was
officially erected as an independent vice-province under the patronage of St.
Joseph in Worker on April 2, 1985, his name was at the top of the list of
those Dominicans who were to be affiliated to the new vice-province. In 1994
he transfiliated back to the Province of St. Albert the Great, but remained
assigned to the Province of St. Joseph the Worker.

While in the United States in the late summer of 2001 to visit his sister,
Sr. Mary Cephas O.P., he suffered a stroke and required hospitalization and
rehabilitation. His one desire was to return to Nigeria and to die there.
Although it seemed as though he were making sufficient progress to make the
return trip to Nigeria, his condition worsened and he was hospitalized on
October 7, 2001. Early on the morning of October 8 he died at Oak Park
Hospital, Oak Park, Illinois. A Mass of Christian Burial was celebrated at St.
Thomas Aquinas Priory, River Forest, Illinois, on October 10 and at the
request of the Province of St. Joseph the Worker the remains of Father
Windbacher were returned to Nigeria on October 23-24. Because of the petitions
of the people, Archbishop Anthony Okogie of Lagos, granted permission to bury
Father Windbacher on the St. Dominic Church compound. A wake began on November
20 and continued through the night until the funeral Mass was celebrated on
the morning of November 21, 2001. Burial was on the compound of St. Dominic
Church, Yaba, Lagos State, Nigeria. See also [**Ambrose's Page**.](http://www.domcentral.org/inmemoriam/windb/default.htm)
