'Élmeyas, whose name also appears in the forms Éleyas, Élmiyas, Él&eacute;meyas and Érmeyas, is mentioned in the *Kebrä Nägäst* ("Glory of Kings") as one of the first-born sons of the elders of Israel who were chosen by King Solomon to accompany his son Menilek I to Aksum, where they were to form the nucleus of his court, holding the same offices as those discharged by their fathers at the court of Solomon. 'Élmeyas is said to have been the son of  'Arni, the liqä-diyaqonat or arch-deacon, who was the son of Nathan the Prophet. With 'Azaryas (q.v.), the son of Sadoq the high-priest, 'Élmeyas became one of the spiritual leaders of the Aksumites and a guardian of the Ark of the Covenant, being confirmed in the office of arch-deacon by Makeda, the Queen of Sheba (q.v.).
