'Éfr&eacute;m Soreyawi (Ephraem or Ephraim the Syrian) was a very famous Syrian saint who became popularized in the Ethiopian Church, perhaps by Z&auml;-Mika'&eacute;l Ar&auml;gawi or others of the Nine Saints.  He was widely acclaimed as a great orator, poet and song-writer, and is referred to by some as "the Harp of the Holy Ghost."  Although little is known about his life, he was a prolific writer credited with 1400 homilies, and his writings are read publicly in the Ethiopian Church, quoted from *W&auml;das&eacute; Maryam, Haymanot Ab&auml;w* and other sacred books.
