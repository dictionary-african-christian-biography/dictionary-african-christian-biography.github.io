Giho W&auml;l&auml;tt&auml;-Mang&auml;sa, (perhaps fl. c. 7th century A.D.), was a Christian lady whose death is commemorated in a Ge'ez inscription from Ham which may be dated to the seventh or eighth century. She lived in the reign of Emperor 'Ellä-Sähel, but the King Lists record several rulers of this name in the century or so before Emperor Gäbrä-Mäsqäl.
