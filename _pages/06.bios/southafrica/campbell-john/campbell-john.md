Scottish missionary and explorer.

He made two extended tours of London Missionary Society stations in South Africa (1812-14, 1819-21) and left one of the earliest and most valuable accounts of the peoples of southern Botswana and the western Transvaal in *Travels in South Africa 1813* (1815), and *Travels in South Africa, 1820* (1822).
