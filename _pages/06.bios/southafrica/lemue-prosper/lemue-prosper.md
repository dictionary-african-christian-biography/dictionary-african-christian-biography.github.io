Prosper Lemue was a pioneer French Protestant
missionary in South Africa. The first French recruit of the
Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (PEMS), as recommended
by the Reformed pastor Antoine Colani, he left in 1829 for
southern Africa with [Isaac Bisseux](bisseux_isaac.html)
and Samuel Rolland. [John Philip](philip2_john.html),
the London Missionary Society (LMS) superintendent at the
Cape, first directed him to Caffraria, but he finally settle
in Botswana, as a colleague of the LMS pioneer [Robert
Moffat](moffatt4_robert.html). He established the Motito station in 1833, working
among Arutsi refugees and Korana people. In 1847 PEMS fellow
missionaries called him to Lesotho to start a school for teachers
and evangelists at the Carmel station. But the Afrikaner Voortrekkers
overran the territory and the proposed school did not materialize.
Nevertheless, Lemue remained and served the small Carmel congregation
until he died.
