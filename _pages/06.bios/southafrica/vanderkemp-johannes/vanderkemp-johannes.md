Pioneering missionary.

After a brief army career in his native Netherlands he took a medical degree in Scotland (1782).  He joined the newly formed London Missionary Society (LMS) in 1798.  One of the first three agents sent by the LMS to South Africa, he was the first missionary to work among the Xhosa (1799-1800).  He became interested in the economic plight of the Khoikhoi ('Hottentot') people in the Cape Colony and strongly advocated granting then legal equality with whites.  He laboured alternately among the Khoikhoi of the eastern Cape and the slave population of Cape Town.  Partly as a matter of principle he married a non-white woman and thereby alienated the white settlers against his work. Armed with a background in European and classical philology, he pioneered in the study of Xhosa and Khoikhoi languages.  He was made the first superintendent of the LMS's South African missions shortly before he died.
