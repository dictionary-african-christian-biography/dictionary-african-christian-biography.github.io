The Rev. Dr. E.J. Mqoboli (b circa 1860), born in the Cape, was an important figure in African politics in South Africa during the first half of the twentieth century. He was a founding member of the South African Native National Congress and was elected chaplain-in-chief at its first conference of January 8, 1912 in Bloemfontein. He later served as the first senior chaplain of the African National Congress.

Mqoboli was trained in Healdtown, first as a teacher and later as a minister of the Wesleyan Church. He wrote a number of religious works, including a Xhosa book, *Intyilazwi*. It was partly for these works that he was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Divinity by an American university.

Mqoboli is remembered for his effective speaking, preaching and writing skills, as well as his active involvement in the Cape and national executives of the African National Congress.
