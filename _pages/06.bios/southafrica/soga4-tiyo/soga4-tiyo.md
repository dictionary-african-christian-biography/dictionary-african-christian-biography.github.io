![Tiyo Soga](/images/bio-pics/southafrica/soga4-tiyo/soga_tiyo.jpg){:class="bio"}

South African minister.

Born in Eastern Cape Colony, Soga went to a mission school and later received more advanced education at Lovedale. He also spent two periods studying in Scotland under the auspices of Scottish Presbyterian missionaries, qualifying first as a teacher and later as a minister at the University of Glasgow. In 1856 he was ordained in Scotland in the Presbyterian Church--the first black South African to be ordained to the Christian ministry. Back in the eastern Cape, he served as a minister at Mgwali (1857-1868) and at Tutura from 1868 until his untimely death. His missionary approach was typical of the time, concentrating especially on preaching and rudimentary teaching. He had, however, a stronger interest than most in the healing dimension of Christian mission.
