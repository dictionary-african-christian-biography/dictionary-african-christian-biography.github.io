British missionary and imperial agent.

A son of Robert MOFFAT, in 1859 he helped to found the first permanent mission among the Ndebele of MZILIKAZI in present Zimbabwe.  Initially he was sponsored by his brother-in-law David LIVINGSTONE, but he soon affiliated with the London Missionary Society.  In 1865 he returned to Kuruman to continue his father's work among the Tswana, quitting the mission society in 1879 to hold a variety of government posts.  During the late 1880s European pressure to wrench economic concessions from the Ndebele was intense.  Moffat went to Zimbabwe as an official British agent and persuaded king LOBENGULA to sign a treaty of friendship which was the precursor of Lobengula's important concession treaty with Charles RUDD (1888).
