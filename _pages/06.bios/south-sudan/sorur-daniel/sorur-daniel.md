In 1875 he took refuge in the Catholic Mission at El Obeid and was accepted by Bishop Comboni who baptized him and sent him to Rome for ecclesiastical studies (1877-1883). After completing his theological course at Beyrut he was ordained a priest at Cairo by Comboni's successor, Bishop Francis Xavier Sogaro, on May 8, 1887. He exercised his priestly ministry in Suakin and Helouan, Cairo. He died in Cairo on January 11, 1900.
