Bruno Gutmann was a missionary ethnographer in East Africa.
A native of Dresden, Saxony, he had a difficult childhood
before he applied for admission to the Leipzig Mission seminary.
At Leipzig he came under the influence of diverse social philosophy
of his own and later supplied the motivation for ethnographic
research. Gutmann served as a missionary from 1902 to 1938
among the Chagga people in the Kilimanjaro area of what is
now Tanzania and became justly famous for his studies on Chagga
religion, society, and customs, which remained unsurpassed
in spite of their methodological shortcomings. Gutmann attempted
to identify ethnic "life power" among the Chagga as determinative
for the incorporation of tribal "primeval links" into the
community of Christ. As a corollary, he expressed violent
opposition to the power of modern civilization, fearing that
it would destroy the tribal order of creation which, in his
view, had not been affected by human sin. While his ideas
proved successful in the congregations at Old Moshi and its
surroundings, they could not but lead to misgivings regarding
the encounter of Chagga Christians with the postwar world.
As he was unable to return to Africa during 28 years of retirement,
much as he wished to do so, he had no opportunity to adjust
his views to changed conditions.
