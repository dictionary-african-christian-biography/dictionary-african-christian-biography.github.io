Philip Marumbini Lishale became a convert at Moiene, the church of Samuel Mulate.  His parents were furious when he decided to become a Christian.

At the Rehoboth Bible College he sought the experience of heart holiness.   Missionary Mrs. Maud Jones describes what she saw:  "Tears flowed.  With closed eyes and upturned face he thumped on his breast calling aloud.  He pleaded with God for His promised gift.  Soon his spiritual struggle ended and his face brightened.  With both hands uplifted he began to laugh for joy."  He would often be praying in the kitchen with an older missionary, Dad Groom.

Back in Gaza, he married Marta from Magude and succeeded Pastor Samuel Mulate as pastor at Moiene in 1923.  Both he and Marta faced bitter opposition from nonChristian relatives.  Not having any children after four years, they were taunted and urged to offer a goat to appease the gods.  They prayed only and had a boy named Power and a girl they named Praise.

Philip Lishale was a passionate preacher and prayer intercessor.  He would mercilessly drag sin out into the light and hold it up to scorn and contempt.  A great sob would come into his voice and tears would stream down his face as he would plead with people to repent.  Marta was a particularly bright and happy Christian and a great help in the Lord's work.[1]

After a brief ministry, both Pastor Philip and Mrs. Marta Lishale died of tuberculosis in quick succession.  Taken in the prime of his life and ministry, Philip Lishale bequeathed to the church a powerful example of a wholehearted and faithful prayer follower of Christ.{2]
