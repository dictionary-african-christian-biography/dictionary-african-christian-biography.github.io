Mhlauli was born at Xai Xai, Mozambique, and came to South
Africa after the Anglo-Boer War. He was baptised in the Wesleyan Methodist
Church, but received a call from the ministers of the Ethiopian Church. Came to
Transvaal for purpose of spreading the gospel, and had two visions, as a result
of which he felt called to found the Gazaland Zimbabwe Ethiopian Church (GNLB
205).
