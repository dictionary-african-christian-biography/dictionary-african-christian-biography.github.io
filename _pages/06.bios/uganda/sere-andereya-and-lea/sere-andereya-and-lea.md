[TORO]

As a young man Rev. Andereya Sere had served in the  enclosure of [Yafeti  Byakweyamba](byakweyamba_yafeti.html)__ and had thus come into contact with Christian  teaching.[1] He was baptized at Butiti by the Rev. [Zakariya Kizito Kisingiri](kizito_zakariya_kisingiri2.html)__ on April 27,  1897.[2] He worked as a teacher under the Revs. A. L. Kitching and T. B.  Johnson at Butiti.[3] In 1903 he was sent to teach at Butanuka for a brief  period.[4] His wife, Lea, had also been trained as a teacher and she received  her letter in 1905.[5] At the request of the Christians of Butiti he was chosen  for ordination.[6] He was made deacon in 1907.[7] He worked for a year at  Butiti and a year at Mboga, and was then ordained priest in 1909, again  returning to Butiti where he remained until 1913, when for two years he worked  at Ngoma. From 1915-1922 and possibly longer he worked in Kyaka, and later also  served in Busongora—like the church teachers he was moved around a good  deal.[8] He officially retired in 1936, but went on doing a little work until  the early 1950&rsquo;s.[9]
