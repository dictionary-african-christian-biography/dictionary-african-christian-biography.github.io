Benedict Ssettuuma was born in 1923 at Butebere,  Ggulama, Narozari parish, Masaka Diocese. His father was Yako Bita of the Heart  Clan and his mother was Felicita Alibawaomukisa Namatovu of the Ngabi Clan  (bush back). He was given the noble name  of Nnattuuma and the Christian name of Benedict. His mother died when he was  about seven years old. As she was dying, Felicita entrusted the boy to her sister  in law, Anna Maria Nnanyanzi Musubika, wife of her husband&rsquo;s cousin (brother)  Ereneo Ddaaki. Thus, after the burial of his mother young Nnattuuma was taken  to the family of his paternal uncle, Ereneo Ddaaki, who brought him up as his  own son.

He did his catechumenate at Narozari parish after  which he continued with primary education at the parish school at Narozari.  Here he came into contact with the education conscious priest, Fr. John  Ssewajje. Fr. Ssewajje inspired Ssettuuma to go to seminary and after  completing his primary education he continued to the minor seminary at  Bukalasa. While at Bukalasa, the rector complained about his name for it  sounded like one given to girls. In the Kiganda tradition, girls&rsquo; names usually  begin with N while those of boys begin with S. In order not to give the  impression that a girl had been admitted into the minor seminary, the rector  then changed his name from Nnattuuma to Ssettuuma and from then on he was known  as Benedict Ssettuuma. His father, that is Ereneo Ddaaki, who held some  authority within the clan, sanctioned and accepted the name. [1]

In 1947, he entered  Katigondo Major Seminary for philosophy and theology. During his stay in  Katigondo, Ssettuuma fell seriously ill and was taken to Lubaga hospital. Under  the care of the doctors there and his young brother Paulo Kayanja, he recovered  and returned to the seminary for his studies. He did his probation at Matale  parish. He was ordained a priest at Villa Maria in December 1955 by Bishop  Joseph Kiwanuka. [2]

His first appointment was at Matale parish where he  was put in charge of schools with Fr. John Kasozi as his parish priest. He was  later taken to Kimaanya Parish. In 1957, he was posted to Bukalasa Minor  Seminary to teach and there he stayed until 1965 when he was sent to Rome to  study music. He returned to Uganda in 1966 and was posted again at Bukalasa  Minor Seminary as a teacher. Here he remained until 1981. From 1982, after a  very serious illness, he was taken to Bwanda as chaplain to the Convent. Later  on he was transferred to Makukulu parish and then to Buyoga. He had two years  of sabbatical in the USA and on his return in 1995 he was posted to Mbirizi  Parish. Early in 1996, he suffered a critical accident at Kyakumpi but survived  after the doctors at Kitovu Hospital treated him. However, this accident  weakened him badly and he was confined to the Rest House at Kitovu for the rest  of his life until 2007, when he succumbed to intestinal cancer and died at the  age of 84. He is buried at Bukalasa Seminary Cemetery.

Ssettuuma was a cheerful, warm person who brought  joy and life to a room. He was exceedingly generous and kind-hearted. Starting  from his probation period at Matale, Fr. Denis Mayanja remembers him as a very  affectionate person, loving to everyone and loved by all: children, youth and  old alike.

He had a magnetic and inspiring personality and infectious  character. He was such an imposing figure that many of his students tried to imitate  him in the way he talked, walked and gestured. He was a man who even impressed the  great professor Rev. Fr. Dr. John Mary Waliggo. His students gave him the name  of Mutuluki, one of the famous chiefs of the time whom he used to quote for  them and so he was commonly known as Mutuluki. His students loved to identify themselves  with him. [3]

Greatly gifted in music, he made church music and  liturgy lively and inspiring. He was a marvellous conductor, and director of a  great band at the seminary. Many Christians and non-Christians alike wanted to  attend the mass in which his choir sang. He was gifted in playing various  musical instruments and he excelled at the piano. On one occasion, President  Amin Dada, best known as the dictator of Uganda, so much admired his gifts when  he played at the seminary day that he gave him a full set of trumpets. Out of  his love for music he trained many musicians and a number of Ugandan musicians  who have developed the music industry were either trained by him or his pupils.  He made a huge contribution in this area. Indeed, at his  burial the fruit of his musical instruction revealed itself in the kind of  classical music played (not usually done during burial ceremonies as the culture  expects a somber mood) by the young men he trained years back. An ex-seminarian  flew from the UK to attend his burial; joined by two of Ssettuuma&rsquo;s former students,  the trio fulfilled the promise they had made to each other that this musical  piece had to be played at the burial of whoever passed on first. The melody  from the violins was so powerful that it left everyone speechless while lifting  the spirits of those who attended the burial. The fruits of Ssettuuma&rsquo;s  capacity in music instruction were displayed to everyone. [4]

Ssettuuma made use of his talents and proved that a  person from a simple background could rise to great heights provided he applied  himself (or herself) fully. One of his talents was his capacity to learn  languages. No one would mistake Ssettuuma for anything other than African; he  never visited Britain, and yet he spoke English as though he were British-born.  Indeed, no one else in Uganda has spoken such refined English. When he went to  America for his sabbatical, he was asked how many years he had spent in England  in order to speak the language so well. His masses were always full as many  came to enjoy the way he preached in beautiful, ringing English.

Ssettuuma spent the greater part of his life and  ministry as a teacher in the minor seminary at Bukalasa. Many priests loved him  and have great memories of him. He was a gifted teacher and instructor: he was  understanding, sympathetic and encouraging to his students but never settled  for mediocrity. His students remember him as a great parent. He was more than just a teacher. He was a  strict disciplinarian but only in order to help his students do well and succeed.  As adolescents, students often find themselves in trouble, sometimes even on  the wrong side of the law. If Ssettuuma discovered a student in this situation,  he would not put them up for dismissal but would discipline them and allow them  to return to class. The students called him *Nkukanze* (meaning &ldquo;I have frightened you&rdquo;) because he used to  administer punishment to deter them from doing wrong. However he did not do it  so severely as to discourage them from pushing ahead nor did he recommend them  for expulsion from school. For this reason, many students preferred to be  caught by him when in error: they knew they would be forgiven. His mercy  impressed many students who went through his hands and they learned how to be  merciful themselves, particularly in their capacity as priests. [5]

Ssettuuma loved nature and the environment. He had  a great sense of beauty. Wherever he went, he created a beautiful compound and  took care of nature. He loved trees, flowers and animals. At the minor seminary  he even had a python. He had come across it while digging with the seminarians.  They wanted to kill it but Ssettuuma took pity on it and took care of it. It  grew up to be a great tourist attraction at the seminary.

Ssettuuma was kind to the poor and disadvantaged. He  gave away almost all he earned to the poor that came to his door. He used the  little money he had to pay the school fees of many poor children around Villa  Maria and in the parishes where he worked. Fr. Ssemomwere Timothy, when he was  a seminarian on pastoral work at Buyoga, was edified by this generosity and an  example of Ssettuuma&rsquo;s kind action saved his vocation, which had been tested by  the insensitivity of some priests there. A woman had come to the parish to see  the parish priest because her marriage was in trouble. The priest refused to  see her and this disturbed the seminarian. He was afraid to speak to Fr. Ben,  as he was known there, because he was sickly and poor. However, overwhelmed by  the dire situation of this woman, he went to Ssettuuma, who listened to the  story. Ssettuuma asked the woman, &ldquo;If one bought you the clothes that you lack  now would you go back to your husband and take care of your children?&rdquo; She said  yes, upon which Ssettuuma went into his bedroom and returned with some money. He  told the woman,&ldquo;I cannot find any more money, this is all that I have but I am  sure it can buy you a *gomase* (the official dress for Baganda Women) and some sugar.  Take it and go back to be a good mother and housewife&rdquo;. That day a Christian  marriage was saved. This is one example of Ssettuuma&rsquo;s many deeds of pastoral  charity.

He loved and enjoyed the priesthood. All those who  knew Ssettuuma remember him as a man who loved the priesthood and did his best  to keep its dignity in season and out of season. What marked him out was his  conviction that a priest should be simple, humble, kind and welcoming to all.  People still remember him as a good priest, loving and caring. Raised so high  by virtue of his position in the church, he still fully identified with the  members of his family and never distanced himself from them. They all knew him  as one of their own and they loved him. He did not have much to give them but  he found a place in his heart for every one of them.

Ssettuuma was courageous in denouncing wrong and  causing change through example. On Mbarara road, at Kyabakuza township, there  was a huge mound of garbage that had grown so big that it served as a  roundabout for the road. It was lamentable. Every time he passed by, on his way  to Buyoga, he told the people to remove the garbage but they just laughed at  him. One Monday, as he came from the diocesan quarters, he stopped by the  place, asked for a wheelbarrow and a spade and began removing the garbage. He  was dressed in his collar. The people then called out in alarm *&ldquo;Banange tufudde, Father waffe ali mu  kuyoola kasasiro&rdquo;* (&ldquo;this is a great shame, our priest is removing the  garbage&rdquo;). The citizens of the townships organized themselves and having pleaded  with him to stop, they removed the garbage. They never put it there again. They  realized that it was an improvement, and hygienic to live in a clean place.  Ssettuuma caused that change.

Finally, many people remember him as a good  preacher and convinced Christian. He never compromised on issues of truth, justice  and morality. He would even undergo pain in order to defend what he thought was  right. Once, when he was over 70, Ssettuuma decided to walk a distance of eight  kilometers because he did not believe in overloading vehicles. At that time, a  saloon car of seating capacity for five would often be made to carry ten  people. When he stopped a car and recognized that they were overloaded, he  refused to take it. The driver pleaded with him, informing him that this was  the last car on the road. Even though it was about eight p.m. he opted to walk in  order to teach them that overloading was wrong.

The last days of his life were mainly ones of  suffering and pain but he lived those years with patience and indomitable  courage. He never complained even when his pain was immense. He used to say,  &ldquo;That is the cross the Lord has given me, it will pass one day&rdquo;.

Although in pain, he died peacefully.
