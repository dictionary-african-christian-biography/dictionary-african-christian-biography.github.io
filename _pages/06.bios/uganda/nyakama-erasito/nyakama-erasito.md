[BUNYORO]

Rev. Erasito Nyakama was one of the first Banyoro to become  interested in Christianity when teachers came to[ Paulo Byabaowezi](byabaowezi_paulo_and_damari_karujuka.html)&rsquo;s headquarters.[1] He  was baptized by the [Rev.  Nuwa Nakiwafu](nakiwafu_nuwa.html) on April 22, 1901, and confirmed by Bishop Tucker on  June 18 of the following year.[2] Immediately started to work as a church  teacher. In 1907 he was chosen as one of three Banyoro to be trained for  eventual ordination.[3] He was ordained deacon in 1911 and priest on November  12, 1912.[4] He spent his whole working life at Hoima and is remembered for his  faithful service.[5] In 1935 this was recognized when he was made a Canon of  Namirembe Cathedral.[6] In 1942 he retired, but continued to take services  until his last illness in 1967.[7] He died on October 2, 1967.
