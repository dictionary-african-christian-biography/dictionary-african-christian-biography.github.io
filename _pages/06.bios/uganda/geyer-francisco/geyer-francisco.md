Bishop Francisco Saverio Geyer was born at Regen in the  Diocese of Passavia in 1859. Geyer arrived in the Sudan when he was  twenty-three years old. His field of work was the Apostolic Vicariate of  Central Africa which then extended from Asswan to the Red Sea shores, from Lake  Chad to Ethiopia and Lake Albert. In 1883 he accompanied the new Vicar  Apostolic, Bishop Sogaro, to Khartoum. The Mahdist Rising broke out after their  arrival and Geyer, Bishop Sogaro and a number of missionaries, nuns, and black Christians took  refuge in Egypt. There he began instructing the blacks while also acting as military chaplain to  the Anglo-Egyptian army. He worked hard for the liberation of his  co-missionaries and Sisters held prisoners of the Mahdi. They were liberated on  September 2, 1898 when Kitchener&rsquo;s troops won the battle of Omduran. Bishop Roveggio  succeeded Bishop Sogaro and the missionaries resumed their work in the Sudan.  Asswan was selected as the center and the new stations of Omdurman and Lul  among the Shilluk were founded. In 1902 Geyer was consecrated Bishop and  succeeded as Vicar Apostolic of Central Africa. He made Khartoum his center and  from there made the famous missionary safaris described in his book *Durch Sand, Sump und Wald* (*Through Sand, Swamp and Forest*). The aim  of these safaris was to discover new fields of evangelization and have exact  information about the inhabitants, and were undertaken between 1902 and 1912.  In 1902 he had nine missionaries to assist him; in 1912 forty-two priests,  forty-five sisters, and thirty-four indigenous catechists, and seven more large  stations had been founded—two in the Nile Province of Uganda. He retired sick  and worn out in 1922 after 40 years of work and devoted the remaining years of  his life to the formation of aspiring missionaries of the German branch of the  Verona Fathers.
