Maria Levocata Nakakeeto was born at Kyamaganda, Masaka, Uganda, the child of  Catholic parents, Matia Mayanja of the heart clan and Theresa Nakibuuka of the  Ngonge clan, on January 25, 1960. She received her primary  education at Kyamaganda Girls Primary School. She did her secondary school  education at St. Bernard&rsquo;s Kisweera and continued to Nkumba University  for a certificate in secretarial studies. After her studies, Bishop Adrian  Kivumbi Ddungu got her a job at Bukalasa minor seminary where she worked as  a secretary for 25 years. Nakakeeto died abruptly on February 3, 2014. She was found in her bed, having died peacefully in her sleep. She was  buried on February 4, 2014.

Maria Levocata Nakakeeto was a dedicated, compassionate and professional  worker. She did her work with dedication and extraordinary promptness. She was  always diligent and meticulous in her work as a secretary and so created peace  for both staff and students: her efficiency meant that mistakes were not made.  She was hardworking and worked overtime, without asking for extra pay, for the  good of the seminary and the seminarians. She did this especially during the  examination periods and when holidays were approaching. [1] Her dedication to  the seminary was also manifest in her discretion and respect for the  confidentiality of the seminary.

Brought up by a tough father and serious mother, Nakakeeto was a strict  disciplinarian. She wanted the children at her home to grow up to be good human  beings and good Christians. She wanted to instil them with the right human,  religious and Christian values. She was never afraid of rebuking and correcting  those in error, even sometimes using the cane. But she did it as a true parent  both to her own relatives and to all those who needed help. In her own village,  every child called her aunt. She had no biological children of her own but all the  children in the village recognized her as their parent. [2]

Trained by Bishop Ddungu and Fr. John Mary Waliggo, Nakakeeto was a  wonderful counsellor. Many people, including those older than her, recognized  this gift and would go to her for help. Despite her busy schedule, Nakakeeto  always found time for people. It is particularly interesting that many priests  and members of the religious community sought her counsel which she always gave  freely. She had an unusual ability to tell people the truth to their face but  had developed the art of doing it without hurting them. She would speak what  she felt without fear or favor. [3]

Nakakeeto was a gifted educator. At the minor seminary, all the  seminarians that passed through during her 25 years there called her mother. In  the first place she was very sensitive to their physical needs as children who  were growing up and used to prepare *chapats* and cakes for them, for which they  always loved her. But she was also very concerned about their moral life and would  rebuke them or teach them some good moral lesson if she found them in the wrong.  Many of them went to her for counselling. She did a wonderful job. Many priests  remember her as having helped them to survive the adolescent tide that would  have destroyed their vocation to the priesthood.

Nakakeeto had a deep spirituality. This made a strong impression on the  seminarians who learned to recognize the value of prayer in their lives from  the example of a good lay person. Nakakeeto was always present at prayers in  the chapel in the morning and in the evening. She never missed mass except when  health would not allow her to attend. She used to say the rosary every day,  going to the nearby cemetery where the priests are buried to pray for them. It was a great lesson for the seminarians and  priests at the seminary, some of whom hardly found time to pray for their own  dead lying in that famous limbo of Bukalasa. [4]

Nakakeeto was dedicated to development. She abhorred ignorance and  poverty and did her best to fight them. She started projects at her home in  Kyamaganda to help family members and needy children. She had a magnificent  banana plantation, a zero grazing project and a poultry project. She used many  of the funds from these projects to pay fees for the seminarians and girls who  wanted to engage in religious study. At her death, she had funded the education  of more than ten priests and she was paying school fees for five major  seminarians and a number of minor seminarians. Her career of paying school fees  for the seminarians began almost by default. One day in 1991 she went to the  cemetery to pray for the dead. There she found a young boy who was weeping at  the grave of one priest, Fr. Joseph Ssenyonga, who had died tragically in a car  accident. After consoling him, Nakakeeto took the boy back to the seminary. But  she observed that the young seminarian went back to weep at the tomb of this  priest every day. She discovered that the dead priest was this young boy&rsquo;s  brother. The boy went to the tomb to ask his brother to help him because they  were going to send him away for lack of school fees. Nakakeeto then decided to  pay for the school fees of the boy who eventually completed school and became  an ordained priest. He is called Fr. C. Kazibwe. From then on Nakakeeto decided  to dedicate her life and resources to the education of priests. [5]

Nakakeeto was a great parent to the seminarians: she was especially  attentive to those who might feel like outsiders, such as seminarians from  Tanzania and Burundi.

She gave up her time and energy to take care of Bishop Ddungu until he  died in 2010.

Nakakeeto was a lady of great heart who understood her mission  particularly as serving God through serving the seminary: as a secretary and by  educating priests. She did this work excellently and that is what makes her a  hero for the church in Masaka and Uganda. She never discriminated against  anyone, knowing well that God calls priests from every tribe, people and  nation. In this way, she promoted the idea of the catholicity of the church  over ideas of tribalism. Nakakeeto now takes her place among the great,  courageous and missionary-minded women of Uganda. In her own small way, she did  her best to ensure that the church gets many good, committed, faithful priests  and bishops.
