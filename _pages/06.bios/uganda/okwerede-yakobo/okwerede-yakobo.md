[TESO]

Yakobo Okwerede was one of the early pupils at Ngora High  School, and was baptized on March 31, 1911 by the Rev. W. Banks. When he had  finished at school he first spent a short time as a teacher, and was then asked  by the government to work as a clerk. In 1922 he was made a chief, and put in  charge of Amoda *stem* in Soroti county where he worked for fourteen  years. In 1936 he was appointed *ebuku* chief of Ngora county, and  continued in this post until his retirement in 1950. He was elected to the  Church Council in 1920, and was later for many years a member of synod, but  since 1954 he has worked for the parish council only, of which he is an active  and leading member.
