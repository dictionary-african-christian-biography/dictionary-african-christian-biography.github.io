Father Auguste Amand Aime Achete was of the White Fathers Mission. He joined the White Fathers in 1882 and was ordained priest in 1886. From 1886 to 1889 he served on the staff of the Jerusalem Seminary, and then joined a party of White Fathers bound for Uganda, where he arrived in February of 1891. During 1891 and 1892 he served in Kyagwe and the Sesse Islands, and after the Battle of Mengo (v. Wars of Religion) he worked in Buddu. In 1894 he went to Bugangazzi ad founded Bukumi station, and in November of the following year was the first European missionary to arrive in Toro where he started Catholic work. When on safari in 1897 he was captured by Baron Dhanis’ Congo mutineers, but was shortly released. In August of the same year he left Toro to become Superior of the Rubaga mission, and for a year from August 1898 he acted as pro-vicaire during the absence in Europe of Bishop Streicher. In 1899 he travelled through Bunyoro looking for a site on which to start mission work. In 1900 and 1901 he was absent from Uganda attending a chapter of the Order in Algeria. In November 1902 he returned as Superior of the Toro mission and worked there until his death.
