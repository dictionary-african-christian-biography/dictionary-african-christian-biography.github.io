[TORO]

Hana Kageye was a sister of the  man who had been *katikiro* during the reign of *Mukama* Nysika,  Kasagama&rsquo;s predecessor. When Toro was invaded by Bunyoro in 1876 she took  refuge in Ankole with Kasagama&rsquo;s mother, and there came to know the customs of  the Bahima women. She returned to Toro when Kasagama was reinstated.[1] She  held an influential position in the *mukama*&rsquo;s enclosure. She was by this  time a widow. She was baptized in 1896, but did not find it easy to give up the  practices of a lifetime.[2] In 1898 she was admitted to communion by the Church  Council.[3] In 1901 she was one of those who volunteered to be trained as a  teacher and she received her letter in 1902.[4] She was then sent to Ankole,  travelling with a large chiefly retinue, and she had to be persuaded to send  some of her retainers home as feeding them all would have been and  embarrassment to the Banyankole.[5] Here she taught the high-born Bahima women  of the court who were veiled and secluded, and only a woman of equal standing  could gain access to them, but she was at an advantage because of her rank and  her previous knowledge of Ankole.[6] She remained for a year, and returned in  1904-1905 for a further year.[7] She then worked at Kabarole teaching the  classes for women, taking charge of the welfare of the girls in the boarding  school, and teaching sewing, knitting and traditional handicrafts. She died  early in the 1930&rsquo;s and is buried near Butiti.
