**Introduction**
Until recently mission scholarship has given priority to the agency of European missionaries in Africa. This has tended to paint a picture of Africans as passive recipients of the faith while the Europeans did the real work of planting the faith in the red soils of Africa. However, more recent scholarship is beginning to recover the role that Africans have played in establishing Christianity in Africa without necessarily undermining the role played by the European missionaries. The story of Harry Kambwiri Matecheta is just such an example of the need to recover the "indigenous factor" in the spread of Christianity in Africa. Matecheta was the first African ordained to holy ministry in the Church of Scotland's Blantyre Mission. He served his church with great diligence and loyalty and was instrumental in spreading Christianity, helping to establish Presbyterianism throughout southern Malawi.

**His Life Story**

A Yao, Harry Matecheta came from  Nguludi in Che Lopsa&rsquo;s village in Chiradzulu district. He first heard about  Jesus Christ at the age of six, during the trip Henry Henderson and Bokwito made  from Cape Maclear to the Shire Highlands in 1876. The two were on a quest to  identify a mission site on behalf of the Church of Scotland. The site they  found was subsequently called Blantyre, to honor the great missionary doctor  David Livingstone who had travelled through the same area in the late 1850s.[1]

Starting in 1884  Harry went to school at the Blantyre Mission up to grade four before becoming a  teacher at the same school. He was later trained in printing. He was baptized  on December 29, 1889. Alongside John Macrae Chipuliko, Mungo Murray Chisuse,  Thomas Mpeni, James Gray Kamlinje, James Auldearn Mwembe and John Gray Kufa,  Matecheta was ordained a deacon on November 4, 1894.[2] These seven men had been handpicked by Blantyre Mission's superintendent David  Clement Scott to form a team of deacons&mdash;a first step in his agenda to develop  indigenous leadership for the African church.[3]

In 1900 a  decision was made by the various Scottish Presbyterian and Dutch Reformed  missions in British Central Africa to ordain Africans to holy ministry. This  decision received great opposition from some Blantyre Mission staff such as R. S.  Hynde, who argued, &ldquo;It is utterly wrong to teach any native he is as good as a  white man because he is not. If he were, he would be on the level with the  white man, but it is because he is inferior that he is under the white man.&rdquo;[4] All the ministers in the Blantyre Mission remained European missionaries until  1911. On March 9, 1911, Harry Kambwiri Matecheta was the first indigenous  minister to be ordained at a service held at St. Michael and All Angels Church in  Blantyre,  a mere three days before Stephen Kundecha was ordained on March 12, 1911 at Zomba Church. The two had been trained for four  years prior to their ordination.

In the subsequent minutes and records of the Presbytery of Blantyre,  Matecheta would be typically referred to simply as &quot;Rev. Harry,&quot;  rather than by his surname as was the custom with the Scottish missionaries.  This might suggest that he was not yet considered a full equal, meaning that  this was an example of missionary paternalism.[5] Yet in many  ways, Matecheta was equal to none in helping to spread the Christian faith in  southern Malawi. He served at Mulanje mission, Ntcheu, Blantyre, and many other  surrounding churches for forty-six years. Despite many challenges, Harry  Matecheta received a certificate of recognition for the valuable service he  rendered as a member of the district council and district school committee in  May 1933 from King George V.[6] Matecheta died on July 13,1962. His remains were laid to a rest at Bemvu CCAP  cemetery, one of the mission stations to which he had contributed so much.[7]

**Contributions to the Church**

The contributions of Harry Matecheta in  southern Malawi were mainly through (1) the spread of Christianity and (2)  through community-level education.

In 1893 Scott selected seven bright  students, including Matecheta, with the aim, as he himself expressed it, of  &quot;making them. into pillars of the church.&rdquo;[8] Matecheta and the rest of the deacons at the  Blantyre Mission were entrusted with preaching and teaching in the surrounding  villages. Also, under a Scottish missionary, together they formed a  &quot;native kirk&quot; session. This responsibility even extended to taking  charge of the Blantyre Mission's various substations. Matecheta&rsquo;s outstanding performance  in these responsibilities, while he was also undergoing basic medical training,  led to his appointment as an evangelist to Ngoniland in the mid 1890s.[9] However, one can also argue that his appointment came at a moment of crisis  following the deaths of a number of Scottish missionaries, which had created a  human resource shortage at the Mission.

Matecheta&rsquo;s work in the Ngoniland began  by identifying the mission site, then building both the church and the houses  at Nthumbi station. Matecheta faced many challenges even to acquire the basic  building materials for the station, for he was suspected by the Ngoni (who were  not yet part of the British Protectorate) of carrying the white man's flag.  With the English Bible as his only weapon, Matecheta displayed great courage  and a resilient focus on his mission. It should also be pointed out that  Matecheta did most of the work at Nthumbi Station with very little supervision  from white missionaries. This was mainly due to the area's bad weather and excess  of mosquitoes, which made the environment unsuitable for white missionaries.  The white female missionaries, Miss Bell and Miss Werner, who were assigned to  be at the station with him were quickly struck by malaria and had to return to  Blantyre. Apart from malaria, life at the station meant facing constant threats  from the tribal wars that were taking place in the surrounding communities, as  well as occasional direct attacks on the station by the Hindi, the Ngoni  chief&rsquo;s war band.[10]

Despite these challenging circumstances,  Ngoniland was widely evangelized by Matecheta. His commitment and hard work were  manifested in the growth of membership of the church. The Blantyre Mission's  monthly periodical, *Life and Work*, lists the statistics in 1904 for the various mission  stations under its care. It is remarkable that Nthumbi has the largest Sunday  attendance of *any* congregation&mdash;with  even more people at worship than at the mother kirk, St. Michaels.[11] Ngwira  noted that by 1905 over 1,400 Africans in the area were being reached on  Sundays by Matecheta. In the same year, the church had 112 communicants, 196  catechumen members, and 46 adults and four children earmarked for baptism. In  order to reach out to these people Matecheta &ldquo;used to give out some gifts of  calico and salt to those who attended church services and long robes to the  chiefs and village headmen to wear on Sunday.&rdquo;[12]

As if these challenges were not enough,  Harry Matecheta committed his life to encouraging and mobilizing children from  villages around Nthumbi Station to attend school. At that time parents were  typically not interested in sending their children to school because they were  assigned to take care of livestock. As a result, he resorted to distributing  gifts such as salt, beads and sugar to the potential pupils as motivation.  Matecheta records in his book that one time a boy threw a spear at him when he  tried to persuade him to come to school.[13] Yet even in such a hostile environment the number of schools initiated and  supervised by Matecheta rose to five. The total number of pupils was as high as  671 by 1905.[14]

The great evangelistic work of Matecheta  at Nthumbi Station and Ngoniland at large can be summed up in a statement by  his Scottish colleague Rev. Robert H. Napier: &ldquo;Nthumbi&mdash; I visited and examined  about hundred candidates either for baptism or the Catechumen. Rather more than  half passed&hellip;these. were a certificate asked sic. for the reliability and  capability of Harry to be a minister, a sight of his work at Nthumbi supplies  it.&rdquo;[15] Again, speaking of the mission work in &quot;Pa-ntumbi,&quot;  the *Life and Work* report reads:  &quot;All this work is supervised by Che Harry Kambwiri, who has proved himself  one of the best teachers we have ever had, and worthy of the trust placed in  him. So many of the natives are quite unable to occupy a place of  responsibility that it is a great pleasure to find one who can carry on such  important work.&quot;[16]

Matecheta also worked temporarily at the  Mulanje mission, which was one of the larger sub-stations of the Blantyre  Mission. In 1893, a Yao chief, Nkanda, waged war on Mulanje Mission, plundering personal  possessions, blankets, medical equipment and clothes. The white missionaries  fled the mission for Blantyre, and some even returned to Scotland.[17] In the absence of leadership at Mulanje mission, Matecheta volunteered to go  and take over the task. The Presbyterian missionary Rev. Dr. Alexander  Hetherwick allowed Matecheta to leave his medical training and take up the  challenge. While heading up Mulanje mission Matecheta led the construction of a  school block at Nkanda.[18] This demonstrated his courage in crisis and his passion for the education of  his people.

**Matecheta Returns to the Ngoniland**

After his ordination in 1911, Matecheta was put in charge of the churches that were in Mulanje, Chiradzulo, Chikhwawa, Ntcheu, and Blantyre. His passion for Ngoniland was, however, still vivid. It is not surprising therefore that he dedicated much of the rest of his career to ministry at Nthumbi station and the three schools which were still in operation by then. Furthermore he was committed to the work of building a church at Bemvu (which lies about five kilometers east of Nthumbi). By then the church was in the hands of an evangelist in the name of James Poya. Following the ordination of three other African ministers in 1923, Matecheta was made full time minister of the churches in the Ngoniland to be stationed at Bemvu. Eventually Bemvu became the new base for both the religious and educational activities of the missionaries.[19]

Despite taking on other tasks, such as  the work of the Blantyre presbytery moderator and the training of African  ministers, Matecheta&rsquo;s passion for evangelism continued. This is manifested in  the record that by 1950 his work among the Ngoni people had produced over three  thousand communicants.[20] At the same time, Matecheta resolved to train teachers by himself to meet the  demand for teachers in all the schools he had introduced in each village. In  doing this Matecheta reduced the financial costs required by the presbytery for the training  of teachers. This act can be described as a display of the trust he had in  other Africans, just as he had been trusted by the early missionaries. And  despite wearing a clerical collar Matecheta did not throw aside his medical  kit. His ministry was holistic: he also ran a dispensary where he helped dress  wounds while his wife acted as midwife.[21]

Generally, Matecheta was quite mild in  his criticism of the colonial regime as shown by his response to the famous  Nyasaland Uprising of 1915, which was led by Rev. John Chilembwe. While  admitting that there were a lot of evil things the white settlers did to their  employees, such as imposing hard labor without appropriate pay, beating and  deriding Africans as &quot;monkeys,&quot; yet he insisted that the radical  approach taken by Chilembwe was wrong.[22] Matecheta recalled a meeting with Chilembwe, where the latter tried to enlist  him:

>
> One day on my  way from Ndunde I spent a night in his home; together with his church elders we  never slept that night as he kept talking about his enmity with the whites. I  told them that the whites had come to help develop our country, they denied. I  told them that if I was to join them then my way was that of love. We needed to  wait patiently to receive freedom and learn from what the whites had brought  for us. After his uprising, his church disbanded, while he was killed.[23]
>

**Conclusion**

The contribution of Matecheta to the  establishment of Christianity in southern Malawi is remarkable. Not only should  he be considered the father of Presbyterianism in Malawi, his evangelistic and  educational efforts over a sixty-year career were almost unparalleled. A  summary of his mission work in Ngoniland shows that he was a man of great faith  and courage with a passion for ministry. Instead of looking at the Ngoni people  as eternal enemies who had troubled not only him personally but also his family  and tribe historically, Matecheta reciprocated with love. As he himself  observed with joy toward the end of his life, &ldquo;The son of a Yao and children of  their enemies, the Ngoni, are now learning together.&rdquo; He worked hard to see the Ngoni  chiefs and their subjects come to Christ just as their children attained  education. To achieve his goal, Matecheta displayed great loyalty to the  missionaries at Blantyre, earned their support, learned from them and built on  their principles. His refusal to join up with John Chilembwe is a further  manifestation of his loyalty to the Blantyre Mission. David Clement Scott once  argued that &ldquo;people will not believe how much an African is capable of until  they have tried him.&rdquo;&mdash;and Matecheta was the first to prove this sentiment  among the Presbyterian missionaries.[24] By proving wrong the critics of David Clement Scott in his agenda for African  leadership in the church, Matecheta opened doors for more Malawians to rise to  leadership in the church while simultaneously setting a very high standard for  them.
