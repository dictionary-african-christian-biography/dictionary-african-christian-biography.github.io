**Affiliated research institutions** are _DACB_ partner institutions in Europe. These institutions:

*   possess valuable archives on African and missionary subjects of interest to _DACB_ researchers  

*   have connections to African educational institutions or are open to establishing such ties in view of the _DACB_ project  

*   can accomodate the presence of _DACB_ researchers and facilitate their participation in courses offered at their institutions  

*   in some cases, have a network of local research-related contacts useful to _DACB_ researchers.

1.  Each research institution will designate a _DACB_ research / liaison coordinator to serve as the official communication facilitator between the institution and the New Haven office of the _DACB_.  
2.  When a Project Luke fellow, specifically co-sponsored by the Overseas Ministries Study Center and the _DACB_ research institution, is headquartered at that specific research institution for any period of time, the designated liaison coordinator is responsible for verifying that the Project Luke fellow completes a mutually agreed upon number of biographies for inclusion in the _DACB_.  
3.  Stories submitted must conform to the _DACB_'s **"Guidelines for Researchers and Writers."**  
4.  While the Project Luke fellow or other _DACB_-related scholar is headquartered at one research institution, he or she is encouraged to take advantage of other local research facilities (archives, museums, libraries). The home research institution is expected to consult with those institutions to verify the adequacy and accuracy of the biographical research and the integrity of the stories submitted.  
5.  The designated research / liaison coordinator appointed is responsible for the accuracy and integrity of the biographical stories prior to submitting them to the New Haven office. Each story accepted for inclusion in the dictionary will be identified with the name of the author, the research / liaison coordinator, and the research institution.

*   **Forwarding biographical stories to the New Haven office.** The designated _DACB_ liaison coordinator will see that the completed stories are forwarded to the New Haven offices of the _DACB_.  

*   **Receiving a copy of the _DACB_ CD-ROM.** Once the stories have been entered into the electronic database, a copy of the entire database on a CD-ROM will be returned to the research institution via the _DACB_ liaison coordinator.  

*   **Register of participating and affiliated institutions.** Research institutions will be listed on the _DACB_ Web site's annually revised _DACB_ Register of Participating and Affiliated Institutions.
