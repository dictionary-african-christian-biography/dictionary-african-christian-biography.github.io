**_Special Provision for Non African Institutions_**  

Non African educational or research institutions catering to African students on an ongoing basis or offering African Studies research-based programs may register with the _DACB_ as Non African Participating Institutions (Second Tier). Most of the expectations and provisions pertaining to African institutions and their appointed liaison coordinators apply with special conditions* mentioned below.  

*   **Collecting biographical data.** Church related educational institutions hold the key to the successful implementation of the enterprise. Although each institution will necessarily utilize an approach in keeping with its own unique ministries and modus operandi, it is the hope of the _DACB_ that faculty, students, church leaders, and missionaries will, with the full cooperation of their affiliated organizations, participate in writing the stories of the men and women who have contributed most significantly to the distinctive nature and vitality of Christianity in Africa at local, regional, national, and/or continental levels.

1\.  Each non African participating institution will appoint a **_DACB_ liaison coordinator**, to serve as the official communication facilitator between the institution and the New Haven offices of the _DACB_.  

2\.  As the _DACB_ is essentially an African endeavor, it is important that any student at a non African participating institution who chooses to write for the _DACB_ be someone who  

*   Is African, residing in Africa, OR  

*   Has spent a significant amount of time in Africa, OR  

*   Has devoted a significant amount of his or her academic career to the study of Africa.  

3\.  Each contributor will undertake this study under the auspices of the participating institution to ensure accuracy of detail and conformity to the standards laid out in the _Instructional Manual for Researchers and Writers._ Having collected these stories, and having determined the adequate merit of those selected for inclusion in the dictionary, the designated supervisor will submit these to the institution's liaison coordinator, who shall forward them to _DACB_ offices at OMSC.   

4\.  Each non African participating institution is responsible for the accuracy and integrity of a biographical study prior to submitting it to the _DACB_ central office in New Haven. Each story accepted for inclusion in the dictionary will be identified with the liaison coordinator, the non African participating institution, its author, and, where applicable, the corresponding institution in Africa.  

5\.  Stories submitted must conform to the guidelines in _DACB_'s _Instructional Manual for Researchers and Writers._

*   **Forwarding biographical stories to the _DACB_ central office.** The designated _DACB_ liaison coordinator will see that the completed stories are forwarded to the New Haven offices of the _DACB_.  

*   **Receiving a copy of the _DACB_ CD-ROM.** Once the stories have been entered into the electronic database, a copy of the entire database on a CD-ROM will be returned to the non African participating institution via the _DACB_ liaison coordinator.  

*   **Register of participating institutions.** Denominations, schools and institutions participating in the _DACB_ will be listed on the _DACB_ website's annually revised _DACB_ Register of Participating Institutions.

*   Forward the collected biographical studies to the _DACB_ offices at OMSC  

*   Provide _DACB_ information on request to those interested in participating in the project
