Heralded by many as one of the "mothers of Kenyan literature," Macgoye, a.k.a. "MOM," was a prolific poet and novelist who chose to write mostly about her adoptive Kenyan and Luo culture. Her many works include an epic poem, "Song of Nyarloka," and "A Freedom Song" as well as several book length works.  

She arrived in Kenya in 1954 as a CMS missionary and married a Kenyan six years later. Her last book, _Rebmann: A Novel_, is the portrait of a pioneer missionary in East Africa." In 2012, she submitted a short biography of [Johannes Rebmann](/stories/tanzania/rebmann-johannes.html) to the _DACB._
