<p><i>A new African ecumenism is coming to life.</i> Christian believers are increasingly ready to hear the uniting voices from classical African Christianity. A spiritual and intellectual vacuum is being filled by the work of <strong>The Center for Early African Christianity (CEAC)</strong>: with digital and print publishing, new research, digitization of archival work, development of theoretical foundations, sharing new narratives, and through the development of African scholars and the empowerment of African religious communities.</p>
<p><strong>Physical location</strong>: Oden House, 616 Prospect St. New Haven, CT</p>

<p><strong>The Jesuit Historical Institute in Africa (JHIA)</strong></p>

<p>The Jesuit Historical Institute in Africa (JHIA), located in Nairobi, Kenya, is an institute dedicated to preserving memory and promoting knowledge in Africa and its adjacent islands. JHIA started in 2010 as an idea of the Jesuit General, Adolfo Nichol√°s, S.J., to encourage the study of his Order's largely unexplored involvement in the evangelization of Africa. Further deliberations pointed to the need for such a study to be carried out within a broader social, political, cultural and religious context. The JHIA's vision was thus expanded to that of offering a cost-effective environment for ground-breaking research on the religious histories, cultures and traditions of the people of Africa and Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>Director:</strong> Dr. Jean-Luc Enyegue, SJ</p>
