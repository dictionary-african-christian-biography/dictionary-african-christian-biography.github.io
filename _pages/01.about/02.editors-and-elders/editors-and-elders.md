Digitizing stories of African Christian leaders and making them accessible to all will ultimately fill a glaring lacuna in African Christian historiography. By digitizing these stories, the DACB ensures their availability in spite of the vagaries of time and circumstance.* (JACB January 2021, p.6)

*My students are delighted and proud to have their biographies appear on the DACB. “Thank you for your help in making me an author,” one said to me lately. Another told me that the subject’s family expressed their gratefulness for his hard work in documenting the life of their father/husband. "You brought our father back to life even though he was dead", they said. The DACB plays an essential role in documenting the stories of Africans’ contributions to the growth of the church both in Africa and around the world. And the collaborative process of producing biographies helps to strengthen global church relationships, functioning as a bridge toward the shared remembering of the stories that make us all into a global body.*

### Council of Elders

Elders are individuals whose long, dedicated service has helped to build the DACB from the ground up: without them, the DACB would not exist. Elders utilize their wisdom and resources to advance the work of the DACB as they feel called. Elders may serve on several boards. They remain in position in perpetuity unless they ask to be released.
