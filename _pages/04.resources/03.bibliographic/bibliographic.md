The following indexes contain potential DACB subjects, both Africans and missionaries, listed here for reference, to inform and encourage future research.

*How to use these pages:*

1. Consult these pages if you wish to write a biography for the DACB and are searching for ideas of people whose biographies do not yet appear in the DACB. A subject without ENG, FR, POR or SWA in the column next to the name indicates that the DACB doesn't have a biography on that person. Subjects with ENG, FR, POR or SWA in the links columns have biographies. Return to the country page to view the story.

2. Consult these pages in order to avoid writing a duplicate biography by checking to see whether the DACB has a biography on a specific person. However, we do invite alternate accounts of a subject's life that enrich and enlarge the biographies already on the website.

3. Here are some bibliographies resources which could be useful. <a href="{{ page.lang | prepend: '/' | remove: '/en' }}/resources/bibliographies/">Here</a>.
