![Trinity Orthodox Church](/images/news/orth-church2017.jpg){:class="bio"}The DACB Advisory Council meeting was held October 6-9, 2017 in Nairobi, Kenya at the St. Mary Magdalene Retreat Center, located at Resurrection Gardens. This year, we had the joy of welcoming from Cameroon Professor Paul Nkwi who had not been able to join us in previous years due to visa problems. The group attended Sunday worship service at Trinity Orthodox Church. One focus of the discussions was the promotion and distribution of the *Journal of African Christian Biography* in African institutions.
