The [October 2020 issue](../dacb.org/resources/journal/5-4/5-4-OCT2020-JACB-ejournal.pdf) of the *Journal of African Christian Biography* (JACB) is dedicated to JACB and DACB Founder Professor Jonathan Bonk on the occasion of his retirement. Both these publications (JACB and DACB) are unique, specializing in the collection and preservation of biographies of African Christians—accompanied by scholarly reflection—from the full spectrum of Christianity across the continent of Africa. Contributors are Christian scholars familiar with the dioceses, parishes, and congregations of the people featured. The collection also includes manuscripts authored by the people featured as well as photographs and other digital resources.

Professor Bonk, born of Canadian Mennonite missionaries and brought up in Ethiopia, is currently Research Professor of Mission Studies at Boston University, Massachusetts. He is the author of *Missions and Money: Affluence as a Missionary Problem*, which remains one of the most challenging books in this field of research.  He also served as Executive Director of the Overseas Ministries Study Center (OMSC) in New Haven, Connecticut where he mentored visiting scholars in addition to his role as administrator and editor of the International Bulletin of Missionary Research (IBMR).

My acquaintance with Professor Bonk dates from his first exploratory visit to Nairobi in 1999 when he introduced us to the DACB Project. Since then we have learned much from him – and continue to learn – even during his retirement. He is an exemplary mentor and a visionary leader.
