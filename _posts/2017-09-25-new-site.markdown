This summer, the DACB website underwent a complete redesign using a flat-file CMS system conceived by leading software development platform Github. The new site has a lightweight digital footprint, loads fast, and can be distributed on USB drives in areas without Internet access. In addition, multiple indexes and a powerful standalone search engine (that works offline) make it easy to do in-depth research on the site.

Indexing of subjects (as catechists, martyrs, etc) is still underway and will hopefully be completed by November. Please do not hesitate to contact us at [dacb@bu.edu](mailto:dacb@bu.edu) if you see anything that needs correcting.
