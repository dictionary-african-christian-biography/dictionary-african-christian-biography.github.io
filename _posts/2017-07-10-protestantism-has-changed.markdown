![](http://www.dacb.org/resources/500-Prots-CSGC.gif){: .bio}From the _Center for the Study of Global Christianity_ (Gordon-Conwell):

For several centuries the Protestant movement was based in Europe, and then North America. In 2017 there are 560 million Protestants found in nearly all the worldâ€™s 234 countries. Of these 560 million, only 16% are in Europe, but 41% are in Africa. We anticipate by 2050, 53% of all Protestants will live in Africa.
