We lament the departure from this life on January 6 of our beloved Professor Lamin Sanneh. In addition to being a close personal friend, he was a staunch supporter and advocate of the [*Dictionary of African Christian Biography*](https://www.DACB.org). Since 1995, when the DACB began to show signs of becoming more than just an idea, he steadily supported the venture by word and by deed, as a consultant, supporter, advisory council member, and as a member of the Executive Committee. He will be sorely missed.

We are therefore pleased to announce two new members who will be joining the Executive Committee effective immediately.

Professor Dr. Jesse N. K. Mugambi (PhD, FKNAS, EBS), from Kenya, has been an active and effective member of the Africa Advisory Council since 2014. He is Professor of Philosophy and Religious Studies, University of Nairobi, from which he graduated with his BA, MA and PhD.  Prof. Mugambi is a committed churchman (Anglican), an exemplary ecumenist and networker, and an extraordinarily productive academic whose interests, ranging across disciplinary lines, have resulted in many noteworthy publications, among which are: *Christianity and the African Cultural Heritage* (2005); “Climate Change and Food Security: A Challenge for African Christianity” and “Profile of African Christianity at Home and in the West” in *Anthology of African Christianity* (Regnum 2017); *African Theology of Reconstruction* (Butare 2016);  “The Future of Theological Education in Africa and the Challenges it Faces” and  "Challenges for Theological Publishing of Scholarly books in Africa" in *Handbook of Theological Education in Africa* (Regnum; 2013); *Christianity and African Culture* (Acton 1989, 2000, 2002); *Contextual Theology Across Cultures* (Acton 2009, with Michael R. Guy). His global travels, extensive consulting, and established contacts with colleagues in institutions across Africa, the Americas, Asia and Europe have proven greatly beneficial to the DACB.

Professor Dr. Nimi Wariboko is the Walter G. Muelder Professor of Social Ethics at Boston University School of Theology. He holds a PhD in Ethics (Suma Cum Laude) from Princeton Theological Seminary, an MBA in Finance and Accounting from Columbia University in New York City, and a B.Sc. (Economics, first class honors) from University of Port Harcourt, Nigeria. An extraordinarily creative and productive academic, both the originality and range of Dr. Nimi Wariboko’s scholarship is attested by his numerous publications in the fields of economic ethics, Christian social ethics, African social traditions, Pentecostal studies, and philosophical theology. Five of his many books are representative of his scholarly energy, originality, and range: *The Principle of Excellence: A Framework for Social Ethics* (Lexington 2009);  *God and Money: A Theology of Money in a Globalizing World* (Lexington 1955);  *Ethics and Time: Ethos of Temporal Orientation in Politics and Religion of the Niger Delta* (Lexington 2010);  *The Pentecostal Principle: Ethical Methodology in New Spirit* (Eerdmans 2012); and  *Economics in Spirit and Truth: A Moral Philosophy of Finance* (Palgrave Macmillan 2014). He has followed with interest the development of the DACB, and looks forward to working with us to ensure the ongoing viability, credibility, functionality, and dissemination of the resource.
